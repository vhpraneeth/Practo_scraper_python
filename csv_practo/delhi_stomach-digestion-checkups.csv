","The liver is the vital organ present in your body. It is reddish brown in color which may weigh around 3 pounds. The gallbladder is attached at the bottom of the liver along with pancreas and intestines. Liver and these organs help in digestion, absorption, and processing of food. The liver filters the blood which comes from the digestive tract and transports the filtered blood to the remaining parts of the body. The liver also makes proteins which are used for blood clotting and also albumin an important protein in blood serum which transports fatty acids and steroids. It also absorbs and metabolizes bilirubin. Bilirubin is formed as the result of the breakdown of hemoglobin, liver stores the iron released by hemoglobin and utilizes it to make the next generation of red blood cells. It also helps in fat metabolization by breaking down fats and making them digest easily. Liver stores carbohydrates which can be broken down into glucose and later used as energy when needed. It also filters blood from waste products, including alcohol and other drugs. Vitamin A, D, E, K, and B12 are stored by the liver.",,"Liver function tests are mainly used to estimate the severity of a disease like alcoholic hepatitis or viral hepatitis, to detect liver infections like hepatitis or scarring of a liver (cirrhosis), to know the effectiveness of a treatment, to detect the side effects of certain medicines.
