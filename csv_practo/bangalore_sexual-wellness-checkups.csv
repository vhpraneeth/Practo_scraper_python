PRL Test,Prolactin Blood,₹300,Serum Prolactin Test measures the amount of prolactin in the blood.  This hormone plays an important role in maintaining a healthy reproductive system in both men and women. Prolactin is produced by the pituitary gland. Prolactin helps in the production of breast milk in women who are pregnant or breastfeeding. The exact role of prolactin in men is not known. ,"In women, your doctor may ask you to perform this test if you have abnormal nipple discharge, irregular menstrual periods and/or infertility issues, or any pituitary or hypothalamus problems. You may be advised to undergo this test if you experience symptoms of elevated prolactin levels such as an unexplained flow of breast milk, visual impairment, headache, abnormal growth of body and facial hair, acne, pain or discomfort during sex, etc.","In men, your doctor may ask to perform this test to check testicular dysfunction, erectile dysfunction, any pituitary or hypothalamus problems. You may be advised to undergo this test if you experience any symptoms of elevated prolactin levels such as visual impairment, headache, abnormal growth of body and facial hair, decreased sex drive, etc. This test may also be performed with other hormone tests such as progesterone, estrogen, testosterone, and luteinizing hormone.",Prolactin levels in the blood may vary over a 24-hour period. The ideal time to draw the blood sample is 3 to 4 hours after waking up in the morning. ,"Inform your doctor if you are on any medications, have any allergies or underlying medical conditions before your PRL Test. Your doctor will give specific instructions depending on your condition on how to prepare for PRL Test.","If the test result falls in the normal reference range, you have an adequate level of prolactin and hence, no further medical intervention is necessary.",https://www.practo.com/tests/prolactin-blood/p?city=bangalore
Testosterone Test,Testosterone Total Blood,₹300,This test measures the Total Testosterone levels in the blood.  ,Luteinizing Hormone   is a pituitary hormone that stimulates and controls the production of testosterone hormone. Secretion of Testosterone into the blood circulation depends on the response of Luteinizing Hormone. Most of the Testosterone which is secreted into the blood binds to the Sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) and a little amount to the albumin. The remaining amount of testosterone which is not bounded and freely circulates in the blood is known as Free Testosterone. The total value of bound and unbound testosterone is total testosterone.,"This hormone is responsible for male physical characteristics and known as a male sex hormone. This is mainly produced by the Leydig cells which are present in the male testicles. LH hormone helps testicles to produce testosterone. In women, testosterone is produced in less amount by ovaries. It is also produced by adrenal glands in both men and women. ","Testosterone plays an important role in the facilitation of spermatogenesis (production of sperm). Testosterone stimulates the development of secondary sexual characteristics in men like the growth of the body hair, deepening of the voice, enlargement of the penis (sex organ in men), muscle development. In women, testosterone is converted to the main female sex hormone i.e:-Estradiol. Testosterone production is high in the early morning hours from about 4-am to 8-am and low in production from about 4-pm to 8-pm. Production of testosterone is high at the onset of puberty and starts to drop at the age near to 30. ","Inform your doctor if you are on any medications, have any allergies or underlying medical conditions before your Testosterone Test. Your doctor will give specific instructions depending on your condition on how to prepare for Testosterone Test.","If the test result falls within the normal reference range, then no need for further medical intervention.",https://www.practo.com/tests/testosterone-total-blood/p?city=bangalore
LH,Luteinising Hormone Blood,₹300,The Luteinising Hormone (LH) test measures the amount of luteinising hormone in the blood. This hormone plays an important role in maintaining a healthy reproductive system in both men and women. It is produced in the anterior pituitary gland. It affects the sex organs in both men and women during sexual development. ,"In women, LH works with the follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) to stimulate the production of estrogen, the female sex hormone. Estrogen further increases the levels of LH, which in turn, stimulates the ovary to release a mature egg. If the egg is fertilized, LH stimulates the production of progesterone, a hormone necessary to maintain pregnancy. If fertilization does not occur, the levels of progesterone drop off, which ultimately leads to the beginning of the next menstrual cycle. Thus, LH plays an important role in menstruation, ovulation, and puberty.","In men, LH stimulates the production of testosterone which is necessary for the production of sperms. Thus, LH plays a major role in puberty and fertility in men.", ,"Inform your doctor if you are on any medications, have any allergies or underlying medical conditions before your LH. Your doctor will give specific instructions depending on your condition on how to prepare for LH.","If the test result falls within the normal reference range, you have an adequate level of LH and no medical intervention is necessary.",https://www.practo.com/tests/luteinising-hormone-blood/p?city=bangalore
HCV Elisa Test,Hepatitis C Antibodies Elisa Blood,₹1000,"Hepatitis is an inflammation of the liver and can lead to scarring, cirrhosis or liver cancer. Hepatitis can be caused due to auto-immune diseases, alcohol or toxic substances. Hepatitis C is transmitted through blood to blood contact with someone infected with HCV. Hepatitis C Antibodies are the antibodies produced by the immune system to fight the hepatitis C Antigens. Antibodies are the protective proteins produced by the immune system and also known as immunoglobulins. Antibodies are produced when any foreign substance or virus or bacteria enters into the body. These foreign substances are known as antigens. Antibodies recognize and attach to the antigens in order to remove them from the body. There are five (5) subtypes of antibodies and they are IgG, IgM, IgA, IgD, IgE.","IgG provides long-term protection as it is present in the circulation for long period after the presence of an antigen. IgM enhances the ingestion of cells by phagocytosis. IgA is also the first defense for intestine, lungs, and nose. They bind antigens to the microbes before they invade tissues and keeps antigens in secretion and when secretion is expelled, antigens are also expelled. IgD helps in the induction of antibody production and presents on the surface of B-cells. IgE binds to the basophils and mast cells. ","This test is performed to check the presence of Hepatitis C Antibodies in the blood. The doctor may ask you to undergo this test if you are suffering from symptoms and conditions such as liver cancer, cirrhosis, jaundice, fever, dark urine, abdominal pain, joint pain etc. This test helps to differentiate acute and chronic HCV infection. If an individual is on the treatment for Hepatitis C virus  , then the doctor may ask to perform this test to evaluate and to check the effectiveness of the treatment and Hepatitis C Antibodies levels in the blood.","This test should be done after 6-7 weeks of infection. If you have been diagnosed with HCV, your doctor may advise you to get this test done once in a year based on your clinical condition. If you are a healthy individual above the age of 35, your doctor may advise you to undergo this test either on a yearly basis or every other year. ","Inform your doctor if you are on any medications, have any allergies or underlying medical conditions before your HCV Elisa Test. Your doctor will give specific instructions depending on your condition on how to prepare for HCV Elisa Test.",If the test results are negative it may indicate that there is no Hepatitis C Antibodies in the blood and no infection of Hepatitis C Virus  .,https://www.practo.com/tests/hepatitis-c-antibodies-elisa-blood/p?city=bangalore
HBsAg Test,Hepatitis B Surface Antigen Quantitative Blood,₹1000,"Hepatitis B Surface Antigen Quantitative Blood Test measures the Hepatitis B surface antigen levels (HBsAg) in the blood. This test helps to determine different phases of Hepatitis B infection and in monitoring response to treatment. Hepatitis B infection is an infection of the liver caused by the hepatitis B virus (HBV). This infection can spread from one person to another through contact with infected blood and body fluids. Common symptoms of this infection are dark urine, fatigue, fever, abdominal discomfort, weakness, loss of appetite, yellowing of eyes, joint and muscle pain. Symptoms usually appear in about one to four months after the occurrence of infection.","Normally in most of the cases, this infection does not last for a long time. Your immune system fights it off within a few months. However, if you have it for more than six months, you are called a carrier. Mostly, adults may recover from this infection completely within a short period of time. Infants and children are more likely to develop a long-lasting infection.","Hepatitis B virus (HBV) has proteins on its surface. These proteins are called hepatitis B surface antigens. It is found in your blood within several weeks (4 weeks) after the infection starts. Presence of hepatitis B surface antigens causes the immune system to make antibodies. Therefore, the hepatitis B surface antigens are the first marker for determining the presence of Hepatitis B infection.",This test is performed to assess the HBsAg levels during the phases of Hepatitis B infection. It is not recommended as an initial diagnostic test for Hepatitis B infection. This test helps to assess the HBsAg levels during the phases of Hepatitis B infection. This test in combination with other Hepatitis B virus DNA tests helps the doctor to evaluate and monitor individuals receiving treatment for Hepatitis B infection. This test measures the levels of Hepatitis B surface antigen and thus helps to assess the treatment response in such individuals. ,"Inform your doctor if you are on any medications, have any allergies or underlying medical conditions before your HBsAg Test. Your doctor will give specific instructions depending on your condition on how to prepare for HBsAg Test.","The test results may be different depending on gender, age, health conditions, and other factors.",https://www.practo.com/tests/hepatitis-b-surface-antigen-quantitative-blood/p?city=bangalore
