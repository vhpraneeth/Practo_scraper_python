PRL Test,Prolactin Blood,₹300,Serum Prolactin Test measures the amount of prolactin in the blood.  This hormone plays an important role in maintaining a healthy reproductive system in both men and women. Prolactin is produced by the pituitary gland. Prolactin helps in the production of breast milk in women who are pregnant or breastfeeding. The exact role of prolactin in men is not known.,"In women, your doctor may ask you to perform this test if you have abnormal nipple discharge, irregular menstrual periods and/or infertility issues, or any pituitary or hypothalamus problems. You may be advised to undergo this test if you experience symptoms of elevated prolactin levels such as an unexplained flow of breast milk, visual impairment, headache, abnormal growth of body and facial hair, acne, pain or discomfort during sex, etc.In men, your doctor may ask to perform this test to check testicular dysfunction, erectile dysfunction, any pituitary or hypothalamus problems. You may be advised to undergo this test if you experience any symptoms of elevated prolactin levels such as visual impairment, headache, abnormal growth of body and facial hair, decreased sex drive, etc. This test may also be performed with other hormone tests such as progesterone, estrogen, testosterone, and luteinizing hormone.Prolactin levels in the blood may vary over a 24-hour period. The ideal time to draw the blood sample is 3 to 4 hours after waking up in the morning.Precautions:Medications that can alter the prolactin levels are estrogen, opiates, tricyclic antidepressants, cimetidine, amphetamines, verapamil, reserpine, dopamine, levodopa, and ergot alkaloid, and derivatives.If you have higher or lower than normal levels of prolactin in blood, you may consult your doctor for further instructions. Based on the test results, your doctor may advise you appropriate medical treatments, lifestyle modifications, or further diagnostic tests.Also known as Prolactin Test, S Prolactin Test, PRL, Prolactin.Test PreparationInform your doctor if you are on any medications, have any allergies or underlying medical conditions before your PRL Test. Your doctor will give specific instructions depending on your condition on how to prepare for PRL Test.No specific preparation is required for this test. Prolactin levels in the blood may vary over a 24-hour period. The ideal time to draw the blood sample is 3 to 4 hours after waking up in the morning.Understanding your test resultsIf the test result falls in the normal reference range, you have an adequate level of prolactin and hence, no further medical intervention is necessary.Low levels of prolactin in both men and women may indicate a decrease in the release of hormones from the pituitary gland. This can be due to a pituitary disorder called hypopituitarism and does not usually require treatment.Small amounts of prolactin are produced in the blood of both men and non-pregnant women. However, high levels of prolactin are normal during pregnancy and in breastfeeding women. A moderate increase in prolactin levels may be seen in individuals with stress due to an illness, seizures, lung cancer, or chest wall trauma, etc. However, high levels of prolactin in men and non- pregnant women can be due to conditions such as liver disease, kidney disease, hypothyroidism, an eating disorder (anorexia nervosa), hypothalamus or pituitary disorders, infertility issues, etc. Polycystic ovary syndrome is also a reason for high levels of prolactin in women. Abnormally high levels of prolactin in both men and women are called prolactinoma, a condition in which a noncancerous pituitary tumor overproduces the prolactin in the body. Symptoms of prolactinoma in women are an unexplained flow of breast milk (galactorrhea), visual impairment, a headache, abnormal growth of body and facial hair, acne, irregular menstrual periods, vaginal dryness, pain or discomfort during sex, etc. Symptoms of prolactinoma in men are visual impairment, headache, abnormal growth of body and facial hair, erectile dysfunction, decreased sex drive, or very uncommonly enlarged breasts etc.GenderAge groupsValueMALEAll age groups3 to 15 ng/mlFEMALEAll age groups4 to 23 ng/ml (Non Pregnant) and 34 to 386 ng/ml (Pregnant)Your Cart0 TestsProceed to CheckoutPackages containing PRL TestWomen's PCOD Detection CheckupIdeal for individuals aged 18 - 45 years37 tests included₹1799₹250028% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowBasic Working Women's Health CheckupIdeal for individuals aged 21 - 40 years63 tests included₹1199₹260054% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowWorking Women's Health CheckupIdeal for individuals aged 21 - 40 years66 tests included₹1799₹330045% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowSenior Citizen Health Checkup - FemaleIdeal for individuals aged 60 - 100 years134 tests included₹3999₹500020% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowThousands of Happy Customers“Very professional phlebo.

Symptoms of prolactinoma in women are an unexplained flow of breast milk (galactorrhea), visual impairment, a headache, abnormal growth of body and facial hair, acne, irregular menstrual periods, vaginal dryness, pain or discomfort during sex, etc. Symptoms of prolactinoma in men are visual impairment, headache, abnormal growth of body and facial hair, erectile dysfunction, decreased sex drive, or very uncommonly enlarged breasts etc.GenderAge groupsValueMALEAll age groups3 to 15 ng/mlFEMALEAll age groups4 to 23 ng/ml (Non Pregnant) and 34 to 386 ng/ml (Pregnant)",https://www.practo.com/tests/prolactin-blood/p?city=mumbai
Testosterone Test,Testosterone Total Blood,₹300,"This test measures the Total Testosterone levels in the blood. What is testosterone?Luteinizing Hormone LH is a pituitary hormone that stimulates and controls the production of testosterone hormone. Secretion of Testosterone into the blood circulation depends on the response of Luteinizing Hormone. Most of the Testosterone which is secreted into the blood binds to the Sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) and a little amount to the albumin. The remaining amount of testosterone which is not bounded and freely circulates in the blood is known as Free Testosterone. The total value of bound and unbound testosterone is total testosterone.This hormone is responsible for male physical characteristics and known as a male sex hormone. This is mainly produced by the Leydig cells which are present in the male testicles. LH hormone helps testicles to produce testosterone. In women, testosterone is produced in less amount by ovaries. It is also produced by adrenal glands in both men and women. Testosterone plays an important role in the facilitation of spermatogenesis (production of sperm). Testosterone stimulates the development of secondary sexual characteristics in men like the growth of the body hair, deepening of the voice, enlargement of the penis (sex organ in men), muscle development. In women, testosterone is converted to the main female sex hormone i.e:-Estradiol. Testosterone production is high in the early morning hours from about 4-am to 8-am and low in production from about 4-pm to 8-pm. Production of testosterone is high at the onset of puberty and starts to drop at the age near to 30.Why this test is Performed?The total testosterone test is performed to understand the functioning of testes. In men, this test is performed to diagnose the hypogonadism, hypopituitarism, impotence, Klinefelter syndrome, erectile dysfunction, testicular tumors, or hypothalamus and pituitary gland disorders. In women, it also helps to investigate the cause of unwanted hair growth, anovulation, tumors of the ovary, absence of menstruation, or masculine traits.Your doctor may ask you to perform this test if you are suffering from symptoms such as underdeveloped muscles during puberty, lack of body hair, enlarged breasts, low energy levels, slow growth of hair, hair loss, loss of bone mass, underdeveloped male genitals (penis), irregular or missed periods, unusual body hair growth in women, heavy vaginal bleeding, or obesity. Your doctor may advise you to perform this test if you are suffering from infertility. This test is also being performed to estimate the effectiveness of the treatment and testosterone levels in the body. If you exhibit any symptoms of testicular dysfunction, your doctor may ask you to undergo this test which gives a better status of the condition. Mostly, this test is done along with other testosterone tests.Precautions:Smoking, chemotherapy, and radiation may change the levels of Total Testosterone in the blood. Hence, inform your doctor about your current status of health and the medications you take.Also known as Testosterone Total Test, Total Testosterone Test, Testosterone Total.Test PreparationInform your doctor if you are on any medications, have any allergies or underlying medical conditions before your Testosterone Test.

LH,Luteinising Hormone Blood,₹300,"The Luteinising Hormone (LH) test measures the amount of luteinising hormone in the blood. This hormone plays an important role in maintaining a healthy reproductive system in both men and women. It is produced in the anterior pituitary gland. It affects the sex organs in both men and women during sexual development.Importance of LH:In women, LH works with the follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) to stimulate the production of estrogen, the female sex hormone. Estrogen further increases the levels of LH, which in turn, stimulates the ovary to release a mature egg. If the egg is fertilized, LH stimulates the production of progesterone, a hormone necessary to maintain pregnancy. If fertilization does not occur, the levels of progesterone drop off, which ultimately leads to the beginning of the next menstrual cycle. Thus, LH plays an important role in menstruation, ovulation, and puberty.In men, LH stimulates the production of testosterone which is necessary for the production of sperms. Thus, LH plays a major role in puberty and fertility in men.","This test is performed to assess the functions of the reproductive organs, fertility issues, ovulation process, and the function of the pituitary gland or hypothalamus. In women, your doctor may ask you to perform this test if you have irregular or heavy menstrual periods, difficulty getting pregnant or fertility issues, and to track ovulation during the menstrual cycle, or if you suspect menopause.In men, your doctor may ask you to perform this test if you have a low sperm count, fertility issues, or signs of low testosterone levels such as a decreased sex drive, low muscle mass, etc.You may also be advised to undergo this test if you experience any symptoms of pituitary disorders. If the doctor suspects early or delayed onset of puberty, this test may be advised. It may also be performed as part of a test panel where hormones such as LH, progesterone, estrogen, testosterone, FSH, etc. are tested.Precautions:Medications such as clomiphene, digoxin, naloxone, birth control pills, anticonvulsants, some hormone treatments, etc. may alter the results of this test. Hence, it is advised that you report all your medications to the doctor before undergoing this test.Also known as LH test, Luteinising Hormone.Test PreparationInform your doctor if you are on any medications, have any allergies or underlying medical conditions before your LH. Your doctor will give specific instructions depending on your condition on how to prepare for LH.No specific preparation is required for this test. Your doctor may ask you to stop taking certain medications such as birth control pills or other hormone pills for up to four weeks before the test. You are also advised to inform the doctor if you have had any test with a radioactive substance in the past 7 days. If this test is being performed with any other tests, you may need to fast (not eat or drink) for up to eight hours leading up to the test; your doctor will provide specific instructions in this case.Understanding your test resultsIf the test result falls within the normal reference range, you have an adequate level of LH and no medical intervention is necessary.In women, increased levels of LH may indicate a condition called primary ovarian failure, where the ovaries fail to work properly. Many conditions such as autoimmune disorders, ovarian tumors, Turner syndrome (a genetic abnormality), polycystic ovary syndrome, adrenal diseases, thyroid diseases, etc. may lead to primary ovarian failure. Women with underdeveloped ovaries and women undergoing chemotherapy or radiation therapy may also exhibit increased LH levels. Decreased levels of LH may indicate secondary ovarian failure. This condition may be caused by disorders of the pituitary gland or hypothalamus.In men, the increased levels of LH indicate primary testicular failure, a condition where the testes are unable to work properly. Many conditions such as autoimmune disorders, germ cell tumors (a type of cancer), Klinefelter syndrome (a genetic abnormality), some viral infections such as mumps, etc. may lead to primary testicular failure. Men with underdeveloped testes and men undergoing chemotherapy or radiation therapy may also exhibit increased levels of LH. Decreased levels of LH may indicate secondary testicular failure. This condition may be caused by disorders of the pituitary gland or hypothalamus. Testicular failure may lead to symptoms such as a decreased sexual drive, tiredness, sexual dysfunction, low muscle mass, etc. This test is useful to understand if the symptoms have been caused by a disorder of the pituitary gland or the hypothalamus. After measuring the baseline LH levels, a  dose of gonadotropin is injected into the individuals. An increase in LH levels indicates a hypothalamus disorder while a decrease in LH levels indicates a pituitary disorder.In children, increased levels of LH may indicate early onset of puberty. In delayed puberty, the LH levels may be normal or lower than normal. Many genetic conditions, some type of cancers, chronic infections, some types of traumas, etc. may result in abnormal LH levels.If you have higher or lower than normal levels of the LH hormone, consult your doctor for further instructions. Based on the test results, your doctor may advise appropriate medical treatments, lifestyle modifications, or further diagnostic tests.GenderAge groupsValueFEMALEAll age groups2 - 18 mIU/mlYour Cart0 TestsProceed to CheckoutPackages containing LHWomen's PCOD Detection CheckupIdeal for individuals aged 18 - 45 years37 tests included₹1799₹250028% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowBasic Working Women's Health CheckupIdeal for individuals aged 21 - 40 years63 tests included₹1199₹260054% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowWorking Women's Health CheckupIdeal for individuals aged 21 - 40 years66 tests included₹1799₹330045% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowSenior Citizen Health Checkup - FemaleIdeal for individuals aged 60 - 100 years134 tests included₹3999₹500020% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowThousands of Happy Customers“Very professional phlebo.

HCV Elisa Test,Hepatitis C Antibodies Elisa Blood,,"Hepatitis is an inflammation of the liver and can lead to scarring, cirrhosis or liver cancer. Hepatitis can be caused due to auto-immune diseases, alcohol or toxic substances. Hepatitis C is transmitted through blood to blood contact with someone infected with HCV.Hepatitis C Antibodies are the antibodies produced by the immune system to fight the hepatitis C Antigens. Antibodies are the protective proteins produced by the immune system and also known as immunoglobulins. Antibodies are produced when any foreign substance or virus or bacteria enters into the body. These foreign substances are known as antigens. Antibodies recognize and attach to the antigens in order to remove them from the body. There are five (5) subtypes of antibodies and they are IgG, IgM, IgA, IgD, IgE.IgG provides long-term protection as it is present in the circulation for long period after the presence of an antigen. IgM enhances the ingestion of cells by phagocytosis. IgA is also the first defense for intestine, lungs, and nose. They bind antigens to the microbes before they invade tissues and keeps antigens in secretion and when secretion is expelled, antigens are also expelled. IgD helps in the induction of antibody production and presents on the surface of B-cells. IgE binds to the basophils and mast cells. Why This test Is Performed?This test is performed to check the presence of Hepatitis C Antibodies in the blood. The doctor may ask you to undergo this test if you are suffering from symptoms and conditions such as liver cancer, cirrhosis, jaundice, fever, dark urine, abdominal pain, joint pain etc. This test helps to differentiate acute and chronic HCV infection.

Hepatitis can be caused due to auto-immune diseases, alcohol or toxic substances. Hepatitis C is transmitted through blood to blood contact with someone infected with HCV.Hepatitis C Antibodies are the antibodies produced by the immune system to fight the hepatitis C Antigens. Antibodies are the protective proteins produced by the immune system and also known as immunoglobulins. Antibodies are produced when any foreign substance or virus or bacteria enters into the body. These foreign substances are known as antigens. Antibodies recognize and attach to the antigens in order to remove them from the body. There are five (5) subtypes of antibodies and they are IgG, IgM, IgA, IgD, IgE.IgG provides long-term protection as it is present in the circulation for long period after the presence of an antigen. IgM enhances the ingestion of cells by phagocytosis. IgA is also the first defense for intestine, lungs, and nose. They bind antigens to the microbes before they invade tissues and keeps antigens in secretion and when secretion is expelled, antigens are also expelled. IgD helps in the induction of antibody production and presents on the surface of B-cells. IgE binds to the basophils and mast cells. Why This test Is Performed?This test is performed to check the presence of Hepatitis C Antibodies in the blood. The doctor may ask you to undergo this test if you are suffering from symptoms and conditions such as liver cancer, cirrhosis, jaundice, fever, dark urine, abdominal pain, joint pain etc. This test helps to differentiate acute and chronic HCV infection.

HBsAg Test,Hepatitis B Surface Antigen Quantitative Blood,₹1000,"Hepatitis B Surface Antigen Quantitative Blood Test measures the Hepatitis B surface antigen levels (HBsAg) in the blood. This test helps to determine different phases of Hepatitis B infection and in monitoring response to treatment.What is Hepatitis B Infection and Hepatitis B Surface Antigen?Hepatitis B infection is an infection of the liver caused by the hepatitis B virus (HBV). This infection can spread from one person to another through contact with infected blood and body fluids. Common symptoms of this infection are dark urine, fatigue, fever, abdominal discomfort, weakness, loss of appetite, yellowing of eyes, joint and muscle pain. Symptoms usually appear in about one to four months after the occurrence of infection.Normally in most of the cases, this infection does not last for a long time. Your immune system fights it off within a few months. However, if you have it for more than six months, you are called a carrier. Mostly, adults may recover from this infection completely within a short period of time. Infants and children are more likely to develop a long-lasting infection.Hepatitis B virus (HBV) has proteins on its surface. These proteins are called hepatitis B surface antigens. It is found in your blood within several weeks (4 weeks) after the infection starts. Presence of hepatitis B surface antigens causes the immune system to make antibodies. Therefore, the hepatitis B surface antigens are the first marker for determining the presence of Hepatitis B infection.","This test is performed to assess the HBsAg levels during the phases of Hepatitis B infection. It is not recommended as an initial diagnostic test for Hepatitis B infection. This test helps to assess the HBsAg levels during the phases of Hepatitis B infection. This test in combination with other Hepatitis B virus DNA tests helps the doctor to evaluate and monitor individuals receiving treatment for Hepatitis B infection. This test measures the levels of Hepatitis B surface antigen and thus helps to assess the treatment response in such individuals.Also known as HBV Surface Antigen Quantitative  Blood, HBsAg Quantitative  Blood, Anti HBs Test, HBsAg Quantitative, HBV Surface Antigen Quantitative, Hepatitis B Surface Antigen Quantitative.Test PreparationInform your doctor if you are on any medications, have any allergies or underlying medical conditions before your HBsAg Test. Your doctor will give specific instructions depending on your condition on how to prepare for HBsAg Test.No specific preparation is required for this test.Understanding your test resultsThe test results may be different depending on gender, age, health conditions, and other factors.If the test results show high levels of HBsAg for Hepatitis B, this may indicate that you are likely to have a hepatitis B infection.  If the test results show low levels of HBsAg, it may indicate a higher likelihood of HBsAg clearance and lower risk of liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma.If the test results show high levels of HBsAg after 12 weeks of therapy, it may indicate a poor response to the treatment.If the test results show low levels of HBsAg after 12 weeks of therapy, it may indicate that your response level to treatment is good.If the test results show low levels of HBsAg during and at end of the therapy, it may indicate that you are responding to treatment.GenderAge groupsValueOTHERAll age groups<5mIU/mlOTHERAll age groups>12mIU/mlYour Cart0 TestsProceed to CheckoutPopular Health Checkup PackagesFeatured CheckupsDiabetes CareWomen's HealthMen's HealthComprehensive Young Indian Health CheckupIdeal for individuals aged 21 - 40 years106 tests included₹2999₹390023% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowYoung Indian Health CheckupIdeal for individuals aged 21 - 40 years60 tests included₹749₹115035% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowActive Professional Health CheckupIdeal for individuals aged 41 - 60 years100 tests included₹1999₹240017% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowComprehensive Active Professional Health CheckupIdeal for individuals aged 41 - 60 years114 tests included₹3499₹490029% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowAdvanced Young Indian Health CheckupIdeal for individuals aged 21 - 40 years63 tests included₹1799₹280036% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowWorking Women's Health CheckupIdeal for individuals aged 21 - 40 years66 tests included₹1799₹330045% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowAdvanced Diabetic Patient's Health CheckupIdeal for individuals aged 35 - 85 years89 tests included₹3599₹500028% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowAdvanced Diabetic Screening CheckupIdeal for individuals aged 35 - 85 years70 tests included₹2199₹300027% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowBasic Diabetic Screening CheckupIdeal for individuals aged 20 - 40 years66 tests included₹1599₹200020% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowDiabetic Patient's Health CheckupIdeal for individuals aged 35 - 85 years77 tests included₹2799₹400030% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowWorking Women's Health CheckupIdeal for individuals aged 21 - 40 years66 tests included₹1799₹330045% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowVitamin Deficiency Health CheckupIdeal for individuals aged 11 - 80 years5 tests included₹1099₹150027% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowWomen's PCOD Detection CheckupIdeal for individuals aged 18 - 45 years37 tests included₹1799₹250028% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowWomen's Skincare CheckupIdeal for individuals aged 15 - 60 years44 tests included₹3499₹550036% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowWomen's Cancer Marker CheckupIdeal for individuals aged 21 - 80 years6 tests included₹2199₹270019% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowSenior Citizen Health Checkup - FemaleIdeal for individuals aged 60 - 100 years134 tests included₹3999₹500020% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowComprehensive Young Indian Health CheckupIdeal for individuals aged 21 - 40 years106 tests included₹2999₹390023% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowYoung Indian Health CheckupIdeal for individuals aged 21 - 40 years60 tests included₹749₹115035% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowActive Professional Health CheckupIdeal for individuals aged 41 - 60 years100 tests included₹1999₹240017% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowComprehensive Active Professional Health CheckupIdeal for individuals aged 41 - 60 years114 tests included₹3499₹490029% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowAdvanced Young Indian Health CheckupIdeal for individuals aged 21 - 40 years63 tests included₹1799₹280036% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowVitamin Deficiency Health CheckupIdeal for individuals aged 11 - 80 years5 tests included₹1099₹150027% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowMen's Cancer Marker CheckupIdeal for individuals aged 21 - 80 years6 tests included₹2199₹270019% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowSenior Citizen Health Checkup - MaleIdeal for individuals aged 60 - 100 years126 tests included₹3999₹500020% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowThousands of Happy Customers“Very professional phlebo.

This test helps to determine different phases of Hepatitis B infection and in monitoring response to treatment.What is Hepatitis B Infection and Hepatitis B Surface Antigen?Hepatitis B infection is an infection of the liver caused by the hepatitis B virus (HBV). This infection can spread from one person to another through contact with infected blood and body fluids. Common symptoms of this infection are dark urine, fatigue, fever, abdominal discomfort, weakness, loss of appetite, yellowing of eyes, joint and muscle pain. Symptoms usually appear in about one to four months after the occurrence of infection.Normally in most of the cases, this infection does not last for a long time. Your immune system fights it off within a few months. However, if you have it for more than six months, you are called a carrier. Mostly, adults may recover from this infection completely within a short period of time. Infants and children are more likely to develop a long-lasting infection.Hepatitis B virus (HBV) has proteins on its surface. These proteins are called hepatitis B surface antigens. It is found in your blood within several weeks (4 weeks) after the infection starts. Presence of hepatitis B surface antigens causes the immune system to make antibodies. Therefore, the hepatitis B surface antigens are the first marker for determining the presence of Hepatitis B infection.Why this test is performed?This test is performed to assess the HBsAg levels during the phases of Hepatitis B infection. It is not recommended as an initial diagnostic test for Hepatitis B infection. This test helps to assess the HBsAg levels during the phases of Hepatitis B infection. This test in combination with other Hepatitis B virus DNA tests helps the doctor to evaluate and monitor individuals receiving treatment for Hepatitis B infection. This test measures the levels of Hepatitis B surface antigen and thus helps to assess the treatment response in such individuals.Also known as HBV Surface Antigen Quantitative  Blood, HBsAg Quantitative  Blood, Anti HBs Test, HBsAg Quantitative, HBV Surface Antigen Quantitative, Hepatitis B Surface Antigen Quantitative.","Inform your doctor if you are on any medications, have any allergies or underlying medical conditions before your HBsAg Test.

Beta Thalassemia Globin Sequencing Gene Testing Blood,Beta Thalassemia Globin Sequencing Gene Testing Blood,₹400,"Beta globin gene sequencing is useful in the evaluation of beta globin chain variants and beta thalassemia. It detects almost all beta globin variants and the most common beta thalassemia mutations, although prevalence is ethnicity-dependent. Because these conditions are often complex, this test should always be interpreted in the context of protein studies, such as hemoglobin electrophoresis and RBC indices. The majority of beta globin chain variants are clinically and hematologically benign; however, some have important clinical consequences, such as erythrocytosis, cyanosis/hypoxia, chronic hemolysis, or unexplained microcytosis. Most of the common clinically significant hemoglobin (Hb) variants (ie, Hb S, Hb C, Hb E, and others) are easily distinguished by hemoglobin electrophoresis and do not require molecular analysis. In addition, they are frequently found in complex hemoglobin disorders due to multiple mutations, and accurate classification requires sequencing data within the context of protein data. In some instances, beta globin sequencing is necessary to identify or confirm the identity of rare variants, especially those associated with erythrocytosis and chronic hemolytic anemia. Rare hyperunstable variants (also termed dominant beta thalassemia mutations) result in hemolytic anemia and do not create protein stable enough to be detectable by protein methods, including stability studies. They are not always associated with elevated Hb A2 or microcytosis and, therefore, can be electrophoretically silent. These require a high degree of clinical suspicion as all electrophoretic testing as well as stability studies cannot exclude this condition. Beta thalassemia is an autosomal recessive condition characterized by decreased or absent synthesis of beta globin chains due to mutations in the beta globin gene (HBB). No abnormal protein is present and diagnosis by electrophoresis relies on hemoglobin fraction percentage alterations (ie, Hb A2 or Hb F elevations).Also known as Beta Thalassemia Globin Sequencing.Test PreparationInform your doctor if you are on any medications, have any allergies or underlying medical conditions before your Beta Thalassemia Globin Sequencing Gene Testing Blood.

It detects almost all beta globin variants and the most common beta thalassemia mutations, although prevalence is ethnicity-dependent. Because these conditions are often complex, this test should always be interpreted in the context of protein studies, such as hemoglobin electrophoresis and RBC indices. The majority of beta globin chain variants are clinically and hematologically benign; however, some have important clinical consequences, such as erythrocytosis, cyanosis/hypoxia, chronic hemolysis, or unexplained microcytosis. Most of the common clinically significant hemoglobin (Hb) variants (ie, Hb S, Hb C, Hb E, and others) are easily distinguished by hemoglobin electrophoresis and do not require molecular analysis. In addition, they are frequently found in complex hemoglobin disorders due to multiple mutations, and accurate classification requires sequencing data within the context of protein data. In some instances, beta globin sequencing is necessary to identify or confirm the identity of rare variants, especially those associated with erythrocytosis and chronic hemolytic anemia. Rare hyperunstable variants (also termed dominant beta thalassemia mutations) result in hemolytic anemia and do not create protein stable enough to be detectable by protein methods, including stability studies. They are not always associated with elevated Hb A2 or microcytosis and, therefore, can be electrophoretically silent. These require a high degree of clinical suspicion as all electrophoretic testing as well as stability studies cannot exclude this condition. Beta thalassemia is an autosomal recessive condition characterized by decreased or absent synthesis of beta globin chains due to mutations in the beta globin gene (HBB). No abnormal protein is present and diagnosis by electrophoresis relies on hemoglobin fraction percentage alterations (ie, Hb A2 or Hb F elevations).Also known as Beta Thalassemia Globin Sequencing.","Inform your doctor if you are on any medications, have any allergies or underlying medical conditions before your Beta Thalassemia Globin Sequencing Gene Testing Blood.

TIBC,Total Iron Binding Capacity Blood,₹250,"The total iron-binding capacity test evaluates the body’s ability to bind itself to iron and transport it around the body and the amount of iron present in your blood. This test helps in diagnosing iron deficiency or iron overload in the body.Iron is a very important mineral needed by your body to stay healthy. The body requires iron to prepare hemoglobin, the protein present in red blood cells which carries oxygen to various parts of the body. When the body lacks iron, hemoglobin may not be produced sufficiently. This condition is called iron-deficiency anemia. Iron binds to a protein called transferrin which is produced by the liver. When the storage of iron in the body runs low, the liver produces more amount of transferrin in order to increase iron in the blood. Iron is also required by muscles, which contain oxygen-binding proteins called myoglobins.This test may be recommended to you for any of these two reasons: Iron deficiency Symptoms of iron deficiency include: Delayed mental development in children, failing to keep up in school, frequent infections, feeling tired and weak, pale skin, headaches, irritability, shortness of breath, swollen tongue, feeling cold, etc.Iron overload Symptoms of iron overload include: Joint aches, stomach pain, tiredness and weakness, weight loss, loss of body hair, loss of sex drive, etc.PrecautionsSome conditions may interfere with your test results like a recent blood transfusion or on iron replacement therapy. Some medicines like antacids (pantoprazole, ranitidine), NSAIDs (paracetamol, ibuprofen, aspirin), etc also lead to bleeding in the digestive tract, birth control pills, chloramphenicol, fluorides, etc. Foods which are high in iron like meat, eggs, leafy vegetables like kale, spinach, collard greens, etc, cereals, wheat germ, raisins, whole grain bread, molasses, beans or drinking milk, blood donation or physical activity can also interfere with your results.Also known as TIBC Test, Serum Total Iron Binding Capacity Blood, Serum Total Iron Binding Capacity, Total Iron Binding Capacity.Test PreparationInform your doctor if you are on any medications, have any allergies or underlying medical conditions before your TIBC. Your doctor will give specific instructions depending on your condition on how to prepare for TIBC.For this test, you may be recommended to fast for 8 hours prior to the test or this test may be done in the early morning with an empty stomach.Understanding your test resultsThe normal test results may vary depending on gender, age, health history, etc.If your test results are higher than the normal range, it may indicate iron deficiency anemia, late pregnancy, etcIf your test  results are lower than the normal range, it may indicate hemochromatosis (a genetic disorder with iron overload), hemolytic anemia (where red blood cells are destroyed), pernicious anemia (where there is a decrease in red blood cells and lack of vitamin B12 absorption), sickle cell anemia (inherited disorder where red blood cells are in sickle shape and die soon), liver disease, inflammation, hypoproteinemia (where protein levels are low), malnutrition, nephrotic syndrome (loss of protein in urine), etc.If you get abnormal test results, consult your doctor immediately.

The body requires iron to prepare hemoglobin, the protein present in red blood cells which carries oxygen to various parts of the body. When the body lacks iron, hemoglobin may not be produced sufficiently. This condition is called iron-deficiency anemia. Iron binds to a protein called transferrin which is produced by the liver. When the storage of iron in the body runs low, the liver produces more amount of transferrin in order to increase iron in the blood. Iron is also required by muscles, which contain oxygen-binding proteins called myoglobins.This test may be recommended to you for any of these two reasons: Iron deficiency Symptoms of iron deficiency include: Delayed mental development in children, failing to keep up in school, frequent infections, feeling tired and weak, pale skin, headaches, irritability, shortness of breath, swollen tongue, feeling cold, etc.Iron overload Symptoms of iron overload include: Joint aches, stomach pain, tiredness and weakness, weight loss, loss of body hair, loss of sex drive, etc.PrecautionsSome conditions may interfere with your test results like a recent blood transfusion or on iron replacement therapy. Some medicines like antacids (pantoprazole, ranitidine), NSAIDs (paracetamol, ibuprofen, aspirin), etc also lead to bleeding in the digestive tract, birth control pills, chloramphenicol, fluorides, etc. Foods which are high in iron like meat, eggs, leafy vegetables like kale, spinach, collard greens, etc, cereals, wheat germ, raisins, whole grain bread, molasses, beans or drinking milk, blood donation or physical activity can also interfere with your results.Also known as TIBC Test, Serum Total Iron Binding Capacity Blood, Serum Total Iron Binding Capacity, Total Iron Binding Capacity.","Inform your doctor if you are on any medications, have any allergies or underlying medical conditions before your TIBC. Your doctor will give specific instructions depending on your condition on how to prepare for TIBC.For this test, you may be recommended to fast for 8 hours prior to the test or this test may be done in the early morning with an empty stomach.","The normal test results may vary depending on gender, age, health history, etc.If your test results are higher than the normal range, it may indicate iron deficiency anemia, late pregnancy, etcIf your test  results are lower than the normal range, it may indicate hemochromatosis (a genetic disorder with iron overload), hemolytic anemia (where red blood cells are destroyed), pernicious anemia (where there is a decrease in red blood cells and lack of vitamin B12 absorption), sickle cell anemia (inherited disorder where red blood cells are in sickle shape and die soon), liver disease, inflammation, hypoproteinemia (where protein levels are low), malnutrition, nephrotic syndrome (loss of protein in urine), etc.If you get abnormal test results, consult your doctor immediately.

DHEA Sulphate,Dehydroepiandrosterone Sulphate Enzyme Immunoassay Blood,₹600,"This test is used to measure the amount of dehydroepiandrosterone present in the blood of an individual. Dehydroepiandrosterone is a precursor for sex hormone secreted by the adrenal glands present on the top of kidneys in an individual. This test is recommended by the doctor to evaluate early development of sexual characteristic in young boys and to evaluate the conditions like virilization (development of hair and male characteristics in women), amenorrhea (absence of menstrual periods) in women and to check the functioning of the adrenal glands or the presence of adrenal tumours, etc.What is Dehydroepiandrosterone?Dehydroepiandrosterone is secreted by the adrenal glands in the body.

FSH Test,Follicular Stimulating Hormone Blood,₹300,"Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH) Test measures the levels of follicle stimulating hormone in the blood.  Importance of FSH:This hormone plays an important role in maintaining a healthy reproductive system in both men and women. Follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) is a hormone produced by the pituitary gland. It plays an important role in sexual development.In women, follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) helps in the growth of ovarian follicle and also stimulate the ovarian follicle to produce the female sex hormone, estrogen. Thus, this hormone plays an important role in menstruation, ovulation, and puberty.In men, FSH stimulates the production of testosterone that is necessary for the production of sperms. Thus, FSH plays a major role in regulating the function of testes in men. This hormone plays an important role in puberty and fertility.","This test is performed to assess the functions of reproductive organs, fertility issues, ovulation process, and function of the pituitary gland or hypothalamus.In women, your doctor may ask you to perform this test if you have irregular or heavy menstrual periods, difficulty getting pregnant, or fertility issues to track the ovulation during the menstrual cycle or if you have menopause symptoms.  In men, your doctor may ask to perform this test if you have a low sperm count, fertility issues, or signs of low testosterone levels such as decreased sex drive, low muscle mass, etc. You may be advised to undergo this test if you experience any symptoms of pituitary disorders. In children, especially teenagers, if the doctor suspects a too late or soon puberty, this test may be performed. This test may also be performed with other hormone tests such as progesterone, estrogen, testosterone, and luteinizing hormone.The FSH test results are not diagnostic, but provides partial information regarding infertility and hence are considered along with other hormone test results such as luteinizing hormone (LH), estrogen, and/or testosterone to establish a diagnosis. Medications that can alter the FSH levels are clomiphene, digoxin, cimetidine, phenothiazines, birth control pills, levodopa, and hormone treatments.Also known as FSH Blood, Follicular Stimulating Hormone, FSH.Test PreparationInform your doctor if you are on any medications, have any allergies or underlying medical conditions before your FSH Test. Your doctor will give specific instructions depending on your condition on how to prepare for FSH Test.No specific preparation is required for this test. Your doctor may advise you to stop taking certain medications such as birth control or other hormone pills for a few days before the test. Hence, inform your doctor about all the medications you take.Understanding your test resultsIn women, the increased levels of FSH and luteinizing hormone (LH) may indicate a condition called primary ovarian failure, where the ovaries fail to perform. Many conditions such as autoimmune disorders, ovarian tumors, Turner syndrome (a genetic abnormality), polycystic ovary syndrome, menopause, adrenal diseases, thyroid disease, etc. may lead to primary ovarian failure. Women with underdeveloped ovaries and women undergoing chemotherapy and radiation therapy may also exhibit increased levels of FSH.  Decreased levels of FSH may indicate a condition called secondary ovarian failure. This condition can be a problem with pituitary or hypothalamus glands. This fails to stimulate the ovaries and ovarian function, which may lead to ovulatory problems.In men, the increased levels of FSH may indicate a condition called primary testicular failure. There are many causes for this condition such as autoimmune disorders, some cancers, Klinefelter syndrome (a genetic abnormality); viral infection such as mumps, trauma, etc. Men with underdeveloped testes and women undergoing chemotherapy or radiation therapy may also exhibit increased levels of FSH.  Decreased levels of FSH may indicate a condition called secondary testicular failure. This condition is due to the problem with pituitary or hypothalamus glands. This fails to produce sufficient male sex hormone, testosterone affecting the development of male characteristics and fertility. Lack of sexual drive, fatigue, low muscle mass, and sexual dysfunction are common in men with low testosterone levels. In children, the increased levels of FSH and LH indicate too early puberty. This condition is more in girls than boys. The causes of this condition are central nervous system tumors or infection or inflammation, brain surgery, trauma, brain injury, etc. In delayed puberty, the FSH and LH levels can be normal or lower than what is expected for a youth within their age range. There are many causes for this condition such as hormone deficiency, genetic abnormalities, ovarian or testicular failure, cancer, chronic infection, or an eating disorder, etc.If you have higher or lower than normal levels of follicle stimulating hormone in the blood, consult your doctor for further instructions. Based on the test results, your doctor may advise you appropriate medical treatments, lifestyle modifications, or further diagnostic tests.GenderAge groupsValueMALEAll age groups0.3 - 10 mIu/mlFEMALEAll age groups0 - 4mIu/ml (Before puberty) and 4.7 - 21.5mIu/ml (While menstruating)Your Cart0 TestsProceed to CheckoutPackages containing FSH TestWomen's PCOD Detection CheckupIdeal for individuals aged 18 - 45 years37 tests included₹1799₹250028% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowBasic Working Women's Health CheckupIdeal for individuals aged 21 - 40 years63 tests included₹1199₹260054% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowWorking Women's Health CheckupIdeal for individuals aged 21 - 40 years66 tests included₹1799₹330045% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowSenior Citizen Health Checkup - FemaleIdeal for individuals aged 60 - 100 years134 tests included₹3999₹500020% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowThousands of Happy Customers“Very professional phlebo.

Free Testosterone Test,Testosterone Free Blood,₹800,"This test measures the Free Testosterone levels in the blood. What is Testosterone?Luteinizing Hormone LH is a pituitary hormone that stimulates and controls the production of testosterone hormone. Secretion of Testosterone into the blood circulation depends on the response of Luteinizing Hormone (LH). Most of the Testosterone which is secreted into the blood binds to the Sex-hormone binding globulin (SHBG) and a little amount to the albumin. The remaining amount of testosterone which is not bounded and freely circulates in the blood is known as Free Testosterone. Free testosterone and testosterone bound to albumin together is the bioavailable testosterone. It is present in both male and female.This hormone is responsible for male physical characteristics and known as a male sex hormone. This is mainly produced by the Leydig cells which are present in the male testicles. Luteinizing Hormone helps testicles to produce testosterone. In women, testosterone is produced in less amount by ovaries. It is also produced by adrenal glands in both men and women. Testosterone plays an important role in the facilitation of spermatogenesis (production of sperm). Testosterone stimulates the development of secondary sexual characteristics in men like the growth of the body hair, deepening of the voice, enlargement of the penis (sex organ in men), muscle development. In women, testosterone is converted to the main female sex hormone i.e:-Estradiol. Testosterone production is high in the early morning hours from about 4-am to 8-am and low in production from about 4-pm to 8-pm.

What is Testosterone?Luteinizing Hormone LH is a pituitary hormone that stimulates and controls the production of testosterone hormone. Secretion of Testosterone into the blood circulation depends on the response of Luteinizing Hormone (LH). Most of the Testosterone which is secreted into the blood binds to the Sex-hormone binding globulin (SHBG) and a little amount to the albumin. The remaining amount of testosterone which is not bounded and freely circulates in the blood is known as Free Testosterone. Free testosterone and testosterone bound to albumin together is the bioavailable testosterone. It is present in both male and female.This hormone is responsible for male physical characteristics and known as a male sex hormone. This is mainly produced by the Leydig cells which are present in the male testicles. Luteinizing Hormone helps testicles to produce testosterone. In women, testosterone is produced in less amount by ovaries. It is also produced by adrenal glands in both men and women. Testosterone plays an important role in the facilitation of spermatogenesis (production of sperm). Testosterone stimulates the development of secondary sexual characteristics in men like the growth of the body hair, deepening of the voice, enlargement of the penis (sex organ in men), muscle development. In women, testosterone is converted to the main female sex hormone i.e:-Estradiol. Testosterone production is high in the early morning hours from about 4-am to 8-am and low in production from about 4-pm to 8-pm. Production of testosterone is rapidly high at the onset of puberty and starts to drop at the age near to 30.Why this test is performed?The free Testosterone test is performed to understand whether the testicular function in men is normal or abnormal.
