HbA1c Test,Glycosylated Haemoglobin Blood,300,HbA1c is used to measure the amount of blood sugar (glucose) attached to hemoglobin over 3 months. This combination of hemoglobin and glucose is called HbA1c. Hemoglobin is a component of red blood cells which carry oxygen from the lungs to the whole body. HbA1c test shows the average amount of glucose present in hemoglobin for 3 months. It is usually done once in three months because typically lifespan of a red blood cell is 3 months.It is used to check for diabetes or prediabetes in adults. Prediabetes indicates that you are at the risk of getting diabetes. If you are already a diabetic patient then it will help you in regulating glucose levels. ,"This test may be recommended to you by your doctor if you have symptoms of diabetes like blurred vision, increased urination, increased thirst, fatigue. Your doctor may also recommend this test if you are at risk of having diabetes. These symptoms include high blood pressure, history of heart disease, overweight or obese, less physical activity. ",If you are diabetic HbA1c test should be done once every three months.  But it may be needed more if you are planning to have a baby or your treatment has changed recently or if you have problems controlling your blood sugar levels.,"HbA1c test results may be altered by different disease conditions like anemia or other blood disorders like thalassemia, kidney disease, or liver disease. Hence inform your doctor or technician about your current medical conditions and medications, especially vitamin C and vitamin E supplements, atorvastatin. HbA1c test results are also altered by your habits like smoking, opium and substance abuse. Temperature also alters the HbA1c levels, mostly during winter and cold conditions there may be chances of the high level of HbA1c.The HbA1c test is not recommended for gestational diabetes. Gestational diabetes is a type of diabetes that affects only pregnant women. It is also not recommended for diagnosing diabetes in children.Also known as Glycosylated Hb Blood, Diabetes test, Glycosylated Hemoglobin test, A1C Test, Hemoglobin A1C Test, Diabetes Test HbA1c, A1C Hemoglobin Test, Glycosylated Haemoglobin, Glycosylated Hb, H1c Test.","Inform your doctor if you are on any medications, have any allergies or underlying medical conditions before your HbA1c Test. Your doctor will give specific instructions depending on your condition on how to prepare for HbA1c Test.No specific preparation is required for HbA1c test.","Depending on your HbA1c test results your diabetic treatment plan is decided by your doctor. Since this test shows the results of three months, it shows how well the treatment is working, if you are already on diabetic treatment. If your HbA1c test results are slightly higher than normal value then it may indicate that you are in the prediabetic stage. If your HbA1c tests results are high, there may risk of certain diseases like heart disease, kidney disease, nerve damage, stroke or eye disease.If your HbA1c test results are higher than the normal range then it indicates that you are diabetic and need to control your blood sugar levels. If you are not on regular medication or if your blood sugars are not well maintained, then HbA1c test results show a higher value.Your doctor may have different recommendations for you keeping in mind your overall health, weight, age, and other factors.GenderAge groupsValueOTHERAll age groups<  5.7 is normal",https://www.practo.com/tests/glycosylated-haemoglobin-blood/p?city=mumbai
Insulin Fasting,Insulin Fasting Blood,500,"Insulin Fasting is a test that measures insulin levels in the blood after 8 hours of fasting or whole night fasting. What is Insulin?Insulin is a hormone produced by the beta cells in the pancreas. Insulin helps in absorption of glucose (sugar) from the bloodstream into the cells of the body. In these cells, glucose is used for the production of energy, which is utilized by the body. In healthy individuals, insulin production is high when the glucose levels in the blood are high and insulin production is low when the glucose levels in the blood are low.Insulin maintains blood glucose levels and prevents hypoglycemia (low blood sugar levels) as well as hyperglycemia (high blood sugar levels). Insulin converts the excess sugar in the blood into glycogen for storage.If insulin secretion is abnormal or if the body is unable to produce insulin, it may lead to an increase in the blood sugar levels; this may cause Diabetes mellitus. If the body is unable to produce insulin, it may lead to type 1 diabetes mellitus. If the body produces an insufficient amount of insulin or if the body cells are resistant to insulin, this may lead to type 2 diabetes mellitus.","Your doctor may ask you to perform this test if you are suffering from symptoms such as frequent urination, hunger, blurred vision, fatigue, increased thirst or dry mouth, unexplained weight loss or weight gain, poor wound healing, foot pain and numbness, frequent infections, itching around penis or vagina, sweating, fast heart rate, sleepiness, headache, nausea, vomiting, etc. which are common symptoms of diabetes mellitus. In some cases, such as the removal of an insulinoma (a tumor of the pancreas), your doctor may ask you to perform this test to determine the effectiveness of the treatment. This test may be performed either alone or in a combination with other tests for better diagnosis.This test is also done to understand whether an individual is having pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas), Cushing syndrome (pink and purple stretch marks along with round face and large tummy), acromegaly (enlargement of the face, hand, and feet), insulinomas (excess production of insulin due to tumor in the pancreas). If the patient exhibits symptoms of diabetes, the doctor may ask the patient to undergo insulin fasting test to determine the status of insulin secretion.Precautions:Medications such as corticosteroids, levodopa, oral contraceptives, etc. may alter the results of this test. Hence, it is advised that you report all your current medications to your healthcare practitioner before undergoing this test.","The frequency of this test depends on various factors like suspected diabetes mellitus, personal history of diabetes, family history of diabetes, body weight, history of heart disease, high blood pressure, gestational diabetes (high blood sugar levels during pregnancy), imbalance of female sex hormones, polycystic ovary disease, etc.","Medications such as corticosteroids, levodopa, oral contraceptives, etc. may alter the results of this test.

Usually, the blood is drawn in the morning after an overnight fast.","If the test result falls within the normal reference range, then the insulin production is normal and you may not need further medical intervention.Increased levels of insulin may be due to obesity, insulinoma, type-2 diabetes mellitus, infantile hypoglycemia, hyperinsulinism (increase in the insulin levels than the normal range), Cushingâ€™s syndrome (pink and purple stretch marks along with round face and large tummy), acromegaly (enlargement of the face, hand, and feet), hyperthyroidism (excess production of hormones from thyroid gland), insulin resistance, etc.Decreased levels of insulin may indicate hypopituitarism (decrease in hormone production by the pituitary gland), Type-1 diabetes mellitus, cystic fibrosis, pancreatitis (inflammation in the pancreas), pancreatic cancer, etc.GenderAge groupsValueOTHERAll age groups<  225mIU/L",https://www.practo.com/tests/insulin-fasting-blood/p?city=mumbai
Fasting Blood Sugar,Glucose Fasting Blood,150,"A fasting blood sugar (FBS) test is used to measure the amount of glucose (sugar) present in your blood after fasting for a whole night or for 8 hours. This test is used to monitor individuals with diabetes. Fasting blood sugar test is the most commonly prescribed test for diabetes and it is the simplest and fastest test.What is the importance of glucose?The main source of energy for all the cells in our body, mostly for brain cells comes from glucose. Glucose acts as a building block for carbohydrates. Carbohydrates are commonly found in rice, cereals, bread, fruit, or pasta. Carbohydrates are immediately converted to glucose, thus increasing the glucose levels in your blood. This condition is called diabetes.","This test may be recommended to you if you experience any of the symptoms like increase urge to urinate, blurred vision, recent weight gain, confusion, change in behavior, if you experience seizures for the first time, loss of consciousness, etc. Increase in your blood sugar levels and diabetes may not always show all the symptoms.Precautions:Some medicines may also alter your fasting blood sugar levels like contraceptive pills, diuretics like furosemide, torsemide, etc, if you are on hormone therapy, corticosteroids like prednisone, prednisolone, etc, aspirin, phenytoin, lithium, epinephrine, sulfonylurea drugs like glimepiride, glipizide etc, tricyclic antidepressants like amitriptyline, etc.Inform your doctor about your past illness or medications, about your present illness and current medication prior to the test.","For individuals above 45 years of age, this test is recommended every 3 years.

Lipid Profile,Lipid Profile Blood,400,"Lipid profile test is a set of tests used to measure the amount of cholesterol and other types of fats present in your blood. This test is helpful in assessing the risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Test parameters:HDL (High-density lipoproteins)LDL (Low-density lipoproteins)VLDL (Very low-density lipoproteins)Total cholesterolTriglyceridesWhat is the importance of lipids?Lipids are a bunch of fats and fat-like substances which are very useful constituents of the cells in our body. They are also an important source of energy. Cholesterol and triglycerides are the two important lipids. Cholesterol and triglycerides are transported are circulated into the blood through lipoprotein particles. Each lipoprotein particle is a combination of cholesterol, phospholipids, triglycerides and protein molecules. Types of lipoproteins?They are classified based on their density into three types. They are:HDL (High-density lipoproteins)LDL (Low-density lipoproteins)VLDL (Very low-density lipoproteins)Total cholesterolTriglyceridesHigh-density lipoproteins (HDL) are considered as good cholesterol and low-density lipoproteins (LDL) is considered as bad cholesterol. High-density cholesterol carries cholesterol to the liver from various parts of your body. Liver functions by eliminating the cholesterol out of the body.  HDL helps in moving the cholesterol away from your arteries. The increased amount of HDL helps in reducing the risk of coronary heart disease. LDL gets attached to the walls of arteries and clogs them. This leads to a condition called atherosclerosis. Total cholesterol is the sum of both HDL and LDL. With the help of total cholesterol and HDL the values, total cholesterol-to-HDL ratio can be derived with which coronary heart disease and stroke can be diagnosed.","The lipid profile test is done to know whether an individual is having normal or abnormal cholesterol levels in the body. The doctor may ask to perform this test if an individual is suffering from conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure and have heart disease or with a family history of heart disease, have a heart attack. This test is also done to determine the risk of developing heart disease. If an individual is on the treatment of anti-cholesterol medications like statins, then the doctor may ask to perform this test to evaluate and to check the effectiveness of the treatment and cholesterol levels in the body. This helps the doctor to rule out the patient disease condition. Generally, when a patient is diagnosed with atherosclerosis or hypercholesterolemia visits hospital for a general check-up, the doctor may ask to undergo the lipid profile test which gives a better status of the condition. Mostly, this test is done along with other tests like an electrocardiogram (ECG), echocardiogram, cardiac catheterization.Precautions:Smoking and medicines like statins (simvastatin, rosuvastatin) may change the levels of lipids in the blood. Hence inform your doctor or technician about all your current medications and medical conditions prior to the test. ","In adults with no risk factors, it is recommended every 4-6 years. For individuals above 20 years of age, this test is recommended every 4-6 years. The frequency of this test depends on various factors like age, history of heart disease, high blood pressure, physically inactive etc. If you are a diabetic or has heart disease or stroke or high blood pressure then this test is recommended every year. Lipid profile test is also recommended at regular intervals to evaluate the lifestyle changes like diet and exercise and to check the effectiveness of the treatment.Also known as LP Blood, Lipid Test, LP.","Smoking and medicines like statins (simvastatin, rosuvastatin) may change the levels of lipids in the blood.
