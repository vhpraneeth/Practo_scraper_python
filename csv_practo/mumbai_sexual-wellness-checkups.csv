SHBG,Sex Hormone Binding Globulin Blood,₹700,"Testosterone, dihydrotestosterone and estrogens circulate in serum bound to Sex Hormone Binding Globulin (SHBG). SHBG concentrations are increased in pregnancy, hyperthyroidism, cirrhosis, oral estrogen administration and by certain drugs. Concentrations are decreased by testosterone, hypothyroidism, Cushings syndrome, acromegaly and obesity. ",,, ,"Inform your doctor if you are on any medications, have any allergies or underlying medical conditions before your SHBG. Your doctor will give specific instructions depending on your condition on how to prepare for SHBG.",,https://www.practo.com/tests/sex-hormone-binding-globulin-blood/p?city=mumbai
PRL Test,Prolactin Blood,₹300,Serum Prolactin Test measures the amount of prolactin in the blood.  This hormone plays an important role in maintaining a healthy reproductive system in both men and women. Prolactin is produced by the pituitary gland. Prolactin helps in the production of breast milk in women who are pregnant or breastfeeding. The exact role of prolactin in men is not known. ,"In women, your doctor may ask you to perform this test if you have abnormal nipple discharge, irregular menstrual periods and/or infertility issues, or any pituitary or hypothalamus problems. You may be advised to undergo this test if you experience symptoms of elevated prolactin levels such as an unexplained flow of breast milk, visual impairment, headache, abnormal growth of body and facial hair, acne, pain or discomfort during sex, etc.","In men, your doctor may ask to perform this test to check testicular dysfunction, erectile dysfunction, any pituitary or hypothalamus problems. You may be advised to undergo this test if you experience any symptoms of elevated prolactin levels such as visual impairment, headache, abnormal growth of body and facial hair, decreased sex drive, etc. This test may also be performed with other hormone tests such as progesterone, estrogen, testosterone, and luteinizing hormone.",Prolactin levels in the blood may vary over a 24-hour period. The ideal time to draw the blood sample is 3 to 4 hours after waking up in the morning. ,"Inform your doctor if you are on any medications, have any allergies or underlying medical conditions before your PRL Test. Your doctor will give specific instructions depending on your condition on how to prepare for PRL Test.","If the test result falls in the normal reference range, you have an adequate level of prolactin and hence, no further medical intervention is necessary.",https://www.practo.com/tests/prolactin-blood/p?city=mumbai
Testosterone Test,Testosterone Total Blood,₹300,This test measures the Total Testosterone levels in the blood.  ,Luteinizing Hormone   is a pituitary hormone that stimulates and controls the production of testosterone hormone. Secretion of Testosterone into the blood circulation depends on the response of Luteinizing Hormone. Most of the Testosterone which is secreted into the blood binds to the Sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) and a little amount to the albumin. The remaining amount of testosterone which is not bounded and freely circulates in the blood is known as Free Testosterone. The total value of bound and unbound testosterone is total testosterone.,"This hormone is responsible for male physical characteristics and known as a male sex hormone. This is mainly produced by the Leydig cells which are present in the male testicles. LH hormone helps testicles to produce testosterone. In women, testosterone is produced in less amount by ovaries. It is also produced by adrenal glands in both men and women. ","Testosterone plays an important role in the facilitation of spermatogenesis (production of sperm). Testosterone stimulates the development of secondary sexual characteristics in men like the growth of the body hair, deepening of the voice, enlargement of the penis (sex organ in men), muscle development. In women, testosterone is converted to the main female sex hormone i.e:-Estradiol. Testosterone production is high in the early morning hours from about 4-am to 8-am and low in production from about 4-pm to 8-pm. Production of testosterone is high at the onset of puberty and starts to drop at the age near to 30. ","Inform your doctor if you are on any medications, have any allergies or underlying medical conditions before your Testosterone Test. Your doctor will give specific instructions depending on your condition on how to prepare for Testosterone Test.","If the test result falls within the normal reference range, then no need for further medical intervention.",https://www.practo.com/tests/testosterone-total-blood/p?city=mumbai
LH,Luteinising Hormone Blood,₹300,The Luteinising Hormone (LH) test measures the amount of luteinising hormone in the blood. This hormone plays an important role in maintaining a healthy reproductive system in both men and women. It is produced in the anterior pituitary gland. It affects the sex organs in both men and women during sexual development. ,"In women, LH works with the follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) to stimulate the production of estrogen, the female sex hormone. Estrogen further increases the levels of LH, which in turn, stimulates the ovary to release a mature egg. If the egg is fertilized, LH stimulates the production of progesterone, a hormone necessary to maintain pregnancy. If fertilization does not occur, the levels of progesterone drop off, which ultimately leads to the beginning of the next menstrual cycle. Thus, LH plays an important role in menstruation, ovulation, and puberty.","In men, LH stimulates the production of testosterone which is necessary for the production of sperms. Thus, LH plays a major role in puberty and fertility in men.", ,"Inform your doctor if you are on any medications, have any allergies or underlying medical conditions before your LH. Your doctor will give specific instructions depending on your condition on how to prepare for LH.","If the test result falls within the normal reference range, you have an adequate level of LH and no medical intervention is necessary.",https://www.practo.com/tests/luteinising-hormone-blood/p?city=mumbai
