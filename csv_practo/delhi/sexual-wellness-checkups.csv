The exact role of prolactin in men is not known.,"In women, your doctor may ask you to perform this test if you have abnormal nipple discharge, irregular menstrual periods and/or infertility issues, or any pituitary or hypothalamus problems. You may be advised to undergo this test if you experience symptoms of elevated prolactin levels such as an unexplained flow of breast milk, visual impairment, headache, abnormal growth of body and facial hair, acne, pain or discomfort during sex, etc.In men, your doctor may ask to perform this test to check testicular dysfunction, erectile dysfunction, any pituitary or hypothalamus problems. You may be advised to undergo this test if you experience any symptoms of elevated prolactin levels such as visual impairment, headache, abnormal growth of body and facial hair, decreased sex drive, etc. This test may also be performed with other hormone tests such as progesterone, estrogen, testosterone, and luteinizing hormone.Prolactin levels in the blood may vary over a 24-hour period. The ideal time to draw the blood sample is 3 to 4 hours after waking up in the morning.Precautions:Medications that can alter the prolactin levels are estrogen, opiates, tricyclic antidepressants, cimetidine, amphetamines, verapamil, reserpine, dopamine, levodopa, and ergot alkaloid, and derivatives.If you have higher or lower than normal levels of prolactin in blood, you may consult your doctor for further instructions.

This can be due to a pituitary disorder called hypopituitarism and does not usually require treatment.Small amounts of prolactin are produced in the blood of both men and non-pregnant women. However, high levels of prolactin are normal during pregnancy and in breastfeeding women. A moderate increase in prolactin levels may be seen in individuals with stress due to an illness, seizures, lung cancer, or chest wall trauma, etc. However, high levels of prolactin in men and non- pregnant women can be due to conditions such as liver disease, kidney disease, hypothyroidism, an eating disorder (anorexia nervosa), hypothalamus or pituitary disorders, infertility issues, etc. Polycystic ovary syndrome is also a reason for high levels of prolactin in women. Abnormally high levels of prolactin in both men and women are called prolactinoma, a condition in which a noncancerous pituitary tumor overproduces the prolactin in the body. Symptoms of prolactinoma in women are an unexplained flow of breast milk (galactorrhea), visual impairment, a headache, abnormal growth of body and facial hair, acne, irregular menstrual periods, vaginal dryness, pain or discomfort during sex, etc. Symptoms of prolactinoma in men are visual impairment, headache, abnormal growth of body and facial hair, erectile dysfunction, decreased sex drive, or very uncommonly enlarged breasts etc.GenderAge groupsValueMALEAll age groups3 to 15 ng/mlFEMALEAll age groups4 to 23 ng/ml (Non Pregnant) and 34 to 386 ng/ml (Pregnant)Your Cart0 TestsProceed to CheckoutPackages containing PRL TestWomen's PCOD Detection CheckupIdeal for individuals aged 18 - 45 years37 tests included₹1799₹250028% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowBasic Working Women's Health CheckupIdeal for individuals aged 21 - 40 years63 tests included₹1199₹260054% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowWorking Women's Health CheckupIdeal for individuals aged 21 - 40 years66 tests included₹1799₹330045% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowSenior Citizen Health Checkup - FemaleIdeal for individuals aged 60 - 100 years134 tests included₹3999₹500020% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowThousands of Happy Customers“Very professional phlebo.

Testosterone Test,Testosterone Total Blood,300,"This test measures the Total Testosterone levels in the blood. What is testosterone?Luteinizing Hormone LH is a pituitary hormone that stimulates and controls the production of testosterone hormone. Secretion of Testosterone into the blood circulation depends on the response of Luteinizing Hormone. Most of the Testosterone which is secreted into the blood binds to the Sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) and a little amount to the albumin. The remaining amount of testosterone which is not bounded and freely circulates in the blood is known as Free Testosterone. The total value of bound and unbound testosterone is total testosterone.This hormone is responsible for male physical characteristics and known as a male sex hormone. This is mainly produced by the Leydig cells which are present in the male testicles. LH hormone helps testicles to produce testosterone. In women, testosterone is produced in less amount by ovaries. It is also produced by adrenal glands in both men and women. Testosterone plays an important role in the facilitation of spermatogenesis (production of sperm). Testosterone stimulates the development of secondary sexual characteristics in men like the growth of the body hair, deepening of the voice, enlargement of the penis (sex organ in men), muscle development. In women, testosterone is converted to the main female sex hormone i.e:-Estradiol. Testosterone production is high in the early morning hours from about 4-am to 8-am and low in production from about 4-pm to 8-pm. Production of testosterone is high at the onset of puberty and starts to drop at the age near to 30.Why this test is Performed?The total testosterone test is performed to understand the functioning of testes. In men, this test is performed to diagnose the hypogonadism, hypopituitarism, impotence, Klinefelter syndrome, erectile dysfunction, testicular tumors, or hypothalamus and pituitary gland disorders. In women, it also helps to investigate the cause of unwanted hair growth, anovulation, tumors of the ovary, absence of menstruation, or masculine traits.Your doctor may ask you to perform this test if you are suffering from symptoms such as underdeveloped muscles during puberty, lack of body hair, enlarged breasts, low energy levels, slow growth of hair, hair loss, loss of bone mass, underdeveloped male genitals (penis), irregular or missed periods, unusual body hair growth in women, heavy vaginal bleeding, or obesity. Your doctor may advise you to perform this test if you are suffering from infertility. This test is also being performed to estimate the effectiveness of the treatment and testosterone levels in the body. If you exhibit any symptoms of testicular dysfunction, your doctor may ask you to undergo this test which gives a better status of the condition. Mostly, this test is done along with other testosterone tests.Precautions:Smoking, chemotherapy, and radiation may change the levels of Total Testosterone in the blood. Hence, inform your doctor about your current status of health and the medications you take.Also known as Testosterone Total Test, Total Testosterone Test, Testosterone Total.Test PreparationInform your doctor if you are on any medications, have any allergies or underlying medical conditions before your Testosterone Test.

What is testosterone?Luteinizing Hormone LH is a pituitary hormone that stimulates and controls the production of testosterone hormone. Secretion of Testosterone into the blood circulation depends on the response of Luteinizing Hormone. Most of the Testosterone which is secreted into the blood binds to the Sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) and a little amount to the albumin. The remaining amount of testosterone which is not bounded and freely circulates in the blood is known as Free Testosterone. The total value of bound and unbound testosterone is total testosterone.This hormone is responsible for male physical characteristics and known as a male sex hormone. This is mainly produced by the Leydig cells which are present in the male testicles. LH hormone helps testicles to produce testosterone. In women, testosterone is produced in less amount by ovaries. It is also produced by adrenal glands in both men and women. Testosterone plays an important role in the facilitation of spermatogenesis (production of sperm).

LH,Luteinising Hormone Blood,300,"The Luteinising Hormone (LH) test measures the amount of luteinising hormone in the blood. This hormone plays an important role in maintaining a healthy reproductive system in both men and women. It is produced in the anterior pituitary gland. It affects the sex organs in both men and women during sexual development.Importance of LH:In women, LH works with the follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) to stimulate the production of estrogen, the female sex hormone. Estrogen further increases the levels of LH, which in turn, stimulates the ovary to release a mature egg. If the egg is fertilized, LH stimulates the production of progesterone, a hormone necessary to maintain pregnancy. If fertilization does not occur, the levels of progesterone drop off, which ultimately leads to the beginning of the next menstrual cycle. Thus, LH plays an important role in menstruation, ovulation, and puberty.In men, LH stimulates the production of testosterone which is necessary for the production of sperms. Thus, LH plays a major role in puberty and fertility in men.","This test is performed to assess the functions of the reproductive organs, fertility issues, ovulation process, and the function of the pituitary gland or hypothalamus. In women, your doctor may ask you to perform this test if you have irregular or heavy menstrual periods, difficulty getting pregnant or fertility issues, and to track ovulation during the menstrual cycle, or if you suspect menopause.In men, your doctor may ask you to perform this test if you have a low sperm count, fertility issues, or signs of low testosterone levels such as a decreased sex drive, low muscle mass, etc.You may also be advised to undergo this test if you experience any symptoms of pituitary disorders. If the doctor suspects early or delayed onset of puberty, this test may be advised. It may also be performed as part of a test panel where hormones such as LH, progesterone, estrogen, testosterone, FSH, etc. are tested.Precautions:Medications such as clomiphene, digoxin, naloxone, birth control pills, anticonvulsants, some hormone treatments, etc. may alter the results of this test. Hence, it is advised that you report all your medications to the doctor before undergoing this test.Also known as LH test, Luteinising Hormone.Test PreparationInform your doctor if you are on any medications, have any allergies or underlying medical conditions before your LH. Your doctor will give specific instructions depending on your condition on how to prepare for LH.No specific preparation is required for this test. Your doctor may ask you to stop taking certain medications such as birth control pills or other hormone pills for up to four weeks before the test. You are also advised to inform the doctor if you have had any test with a radioactive substance in the past 7 days. If this test is being performed with any other tests, you may need to fast (not eat or drink) for up to eight hours leading up to the test; your doctor will provide specific instructions in this case.Understanding your test resultsIf the test result falls within the normal reference range, you have an adequate level of LH and no medical intervention is necessary.In women, increased levels of LH may indicate a condition called primary ovarian failure, where the ovaries fail to work properly. Many conditions such as autoimmune disorders, ovarian tumors, Turner syndrome (a genetic abnormality), polycystic ovary syndrome, adrenal diseases, thyroid diseases, etc. may lead to primary ovarian failure. Women with underdeveloped ovaries and women undergoing chemotherapy or radiation therapy may also exhibit increased LH levels. Decreased levels of LH may indicate secondary ovarian failure. This condition may be caused by disorders of the pituitary gland or hypothalamus.In men, the increased levels of LH indicate primary testicular failure, a condition where the testes are unable to work properly. Many conditions such as autoimmune disorders, germ cell tumors (a type of cancer), Klinefelter syndrome (a genetic abnormality), some viral infections such as mumps, etc. may lead to primary testicular failure. Men with underdeveloped testes and men undergoing chemotherapy or radiation therapy may also exhibit increased levels of LH. Decreased levels of LH may indicate secondary testicular failure. This condition may be caused by disorders of the pituitary gland or hypothalamus. Testicular failure may lead to symptoms such as a decreased sexual drive, tiredness, sexual dysfunction, low muscle mass, etc. This test is useful to understand if the symptoms have been caused by a disorder of the pituitary gland or the hypothalamus. After measuring the baseline LH levels, a  dose of gonadotropin is injected into the individuals. An increase in LH levels indicates a hypothalamus disorder while a decrease in LH levels indicates a pituitary disorder.In children, increased levels of LH may indicate early onset of puberty. In delayed puberty, the LH levels may be normal or lower than normal. Many genetic conditions, some type of cancers, chronic infections, some types of traumas, etc. may result in abnormal LH levels.If you have higher or lower than normal levels of the LH hormone, consult your doctor for further instructions. Based on the test results, your doctor may advise appropriate medical treatments, lifestyle modifications, or further diagnostic tests.GenderAge groupsValueFEMALEAll age groups2 - 18 mIU/mlYour Cart0 TestsProceed to CheckoutPackages containing LHWomen's PCOD Detection CheckupIdeal for individuals aged 18 - 45 years37 tests included₹1799₹250028% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowBasic Working Women's Health CheckupIdeal for individuals aged 21 - 40 years63 tests included₹1199₹260054% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowWorking Women's Health CheckupIdeal for individuals aged 21 - 40 years66 tests included₹1799₹330045% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowSenior Citizen Health Checkup - FemaleIdeal for individuals aged 60 - 100 years134 tests included₹3999₹500020% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowThousands of Happy Customers“Very professional phlebo.

HCV Elisa Test,Hepatitis C Antibodies Elisa Blood,1000,"Hepatitis is an inflammation of the liver and can lead to scarring, cirrhosis or liver cancer. Hepatitis can be caused due to auto-immune diseases, alcohol or toxic substances. Hepatitis C is transmitted through blood to blood contact with someone infected with HCV.Hepatitis C Antibodies are the antibodies produced by the immune system to fight the hepatitis C Antigens. Antibodies are the protective proteins produced by the immune system and also known as immunoglobulins. Antibodies are produced when any foreign substance or virus or bacteria enters into the body. These foreign substances are known as antigens. Antibodies recognize and attach to the antigens in order to remove them from the body. There are five (5) subtypes of antibodies and they are IgG, IgM, IgA, IgD, IgE.IgG provides long-term protection as it is present in the circulation for long period after the presence of an antigen. IgM enhances the ingestion of cells by phagocytosis. IgA is also the first defense for intestine, lungs, and nose. They bind antigens to the microbes before they invade tissues and keeps antigens in secretion and when secretion is expelled, antigens are also expelled. IgD helps in the induction of antibody production and presents on the surface of B-cells. IgE binds to the basophils and mast cells. Why This test Is Performed?This test is performed to check the presence of Hepatitis C Antibodies in the blood. The doctor may ask you to undergo this test if you are suffering from symptoms and conditions such as liver cancer, cirrhosis, jaundice, fever, dark urine, abdominal pain, joint pain etc. This test helps to differentiate acute and chronic HCV infection. If an individual is on the treatment for Hepatitis C virus HCV, then the doctor may ask to perform this test to evaluate and to check the effectiveness of the treatment and Hepatitis C Antibodies levels in the blood.How Often This Test Should Be Performed?This test should be done after 6-7 weeks of infection. If you have been diagnosed with HCV, your doctor may advise you to get this test done once in a year based on your clinical condition. If you are a healthy individual above the age of 35, your doctor may advise you to undergo this test either on a yearly basis or every other year.Precautions:Some medications may change the levels of antibodies in the blood and hence you are advised to inform all your current medications to the doctor prior to the test. Rheumatoid factor and autoimmune diseases can give rise to false positive results.

Hepatitis can be caused due to auto-immune diseases, alcohol or toxic substances. Hepatitis C is transmitted through blood to blood contact with someone infected with HCV.Hepatitis C Antibodies are the antibodies produced by the immune system to fight the hepatitis C Antigens. Antibodies are the protective proteins produced by the immune system and also known as immunoglobulins. Antibodies are produced when any foreign substance or virus or bacteria enters into the body. These foreign substances are known as antigens. Antibodies recognize and attach to the antigens in order to remove them from the body. There are five (5) subtypes of antibodies and they are IgG, IgM, IgA, IgD, IgE.IgG provides long-term protection as it is present in the circulation for long period after the presence of an antigen. IgM enhances the ingestion of cells by phagocytosis. IgA is also the first defense for intestine, lungs, and nose. They bind antigens to the microbes before they invade tissues and keeps antigens in secretion and when secretion is expelled, antigens are also expelled. IgD helps in the induction of antibody production and presents on the surface of B-cells. IgE binds to the basophils and mast cells. Why This test Is Performed?This test is performed to check the presence of Hepatitis C Antibodies in the blood. The doctor may ask you to undergo this test if you are suffering from symptoms and conditions such as liver cancer, cirrhosis, jaundice, fever, dark urine, abdominal pain, joint pain etc. This test helps to differentiate acute and chronic HCV infection. If an individual is on the treatment for Hepatitis C virus HCV, then the doctor may ask to perform this test to evaluate and to check the effectiveness of the treatment and Hepatitis C Antibodies levels in the blood.How Often This Test Should Be Performed?This test should be done after 6-7 weeks of infection. If you have been diagnosed with HCV, your doctor may advise you to get this test done once in a year based on your clinical condition. If you are a healthy individual above the age of 35, your doctor may advise you to undergo this test either on a yearly basis or every other year.Precautions:Some medications may change the levels of antibodies in the blood and hence you are advised to inform all your current medications to the doctor prior to the test. Rheumatoid factor and autoimmune diseases can give rise to false positive results. False negative results are seen in early acute infection and immunosuppression.Also known as HCV Antibodies ELISA Blood, Anti HCVAb ELISA Blood, Anti Hepatitis C Virus Antibodies ELISA Blood, Anti HCVAb ELISA, Anti Hepatitis C Virus Antibodies ELISA, HCV Antibodies ELISA, Hepatitis C Antibodies ELISA.Test PreparationInform your doctor if you are on any medications, have any allergies or underlying medical conditions before your HCV Elisa Test.

HBsAg Test,Hepatitis B Surface Antigen Quantitative Blood,1000,"Hepatitis B Surface Antigen Quantitative Blood Test measures the Hepatitis B surface antigen levels (HBsAg) in the blood. This test helps to determine different phases of Hepatitis B infection and in monitoring response to treatment.What is Hepatitis B Infection and Hepatitis B Surface Antigen?Hepatitis B infection is an infection of the liver caused by the hepatitis B virus (HBV). This infection can spread from one person to another through contact with infected blood and body fluids. Common symptoms of this infection are dark urine, fatigue, fever, abdominal discomfort, weakness, loss of appetite, yellowing of eyes, joint and muscle pain. Symptoms usually appear in about one to four months after the occurrence of infection.Normally in most of the cases, this infection does not last for a long time. Your immune system fights it off within a few months. However, if you have it for more than six months, you are called a carrier. Mostly, adults may recover from this infection completely within a short period of time. Infants and children are more likely to develop a long-lasting infection.Hepatitis B virus (HBV) has proteins on its surface. These proteins are called hepatitis B surface antigens. It is found in your blood within several weeks (4 weeks) after the infection starts. Presence of hepatitis B surface antigens causes the immune system to make antibodies. Therefore, the hepatitis B surface antigens are the first marker for determining the presence of Hepatitis B infection.","This test is performed to assess the HBsAg levels during the phases of Hepatitis B infection. It is not recommended as an initial diagnostic test for Hepatitis B infection. This test helps to assess the HBsAg levels during the phases of Hepatitis B infection. This test in combination with other Hepatitis B virus DNA tests helps the doctor to evaluate and monitor individuals receiving treatment for Hepatitis B infection. This test measures the levels of Hepatitis B surface antigen and thus helps to assess the treatment response in such individuals.Also known as HBV Surface Antigen Quantitative  Blood, HBsAg Quantitative  Blood, Anti HBs Test, HBsAg Quantitative, HBV Surface Antigen Quantitative, Hepatitis B Surface Antigen Quantitative.Test PreparationInform your doctor if you are on any medications, have any allergies or underlying medical conditions before your HBsAg Test. Your doctor will give specific instructions depending on your condition on how to prepare for HBsAg Test.No specific preparation is required for this test.Understanding your test resultsThe test results may be different depending on gender, age, health conditions, and other factors.If the test results show high levels of HBsAg for Hepatitis B, this may indicate that you are likely to have a hepatitis B infection.  If the test results show low levels of HBsAg, it may indicate a higher likelihood of HBsAg clearance and lower risk of liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma.If the test results show high levels of HBsAg after 12 weeks of therapy, it may indicate a poor response to the treatment.If the test results show low levels of HBsAg after 12 weeks of therapy, it may indicate that your response level to treatment is good.If the test results show low levels of HBsAg during and at end of the therapy, it may indicate that you are responding to treatment.GenderAge groupsValueOTHERAll age groups<5mIU/mlOTHERAll age groups>12mIU/mlYour Cart0 TestsProceed to CheckoutPopular Health Checkup PackagesFeatured CheckupsDiabetes CareWomen's HealthMen's HealthActive Professional Health CheckupIdeal for individuals aged 41 - 60 years100 tests included₹1999₹240017% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowAdvanced Young Indian Health CheckupIdeal for individuals aged 21 - 40 years63 tests included₹1799₹280036% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowComprehensive Young Indian Health CheckupIdeal for individuals aged 21 - 40 years106 tests included₹2999₹390023% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowWorking Women's Health CheckupIdeal for individuals aged 21 - 40 years66 tests included₹1799₹330045% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowYoung Indian Health CheckupIdeal for individuals aged 21 - 40 years60 tests included₹749₹115035% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowAdvanced Diabetic Patient's Health CheckupIdeal for individuals aged 35 - 85 years89 tests included₹3599₹500028% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowAdvanced Diabetic Screening CheckupIdeal for individuals aged 35 - 85 years70 tests included₹2199₹300027% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowBasic Diabetic Screening CheckupIdeal for individuals aged 20 - 40 years66 tests included₹1599₹200020% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowDiabetic Patient's Health CheckupIdeal for individuals aged 35 - 85 years77 tests included₹2799₹400030% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowWorking Women's Health CheckupIdeal for individuals aged 21 - 40 years66 tests included₹1799₹330045% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowVitamin Deficiency Health CheckupIdeal for individuals aged 11 - 80 years5 tests included₹1099₹150027% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowWomen's PCOD Detection CheckupIdeal for individuals aged 18 - 45 years37 tests included₹1799₹250028% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowWomen's Skincare CheckupIdeal for individuals aged 15 - 60 years44 tests included₹3499₹550036% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowWomen's Cancer Marker CheckupIdeal for individuals aged 21 - 80 years6 tests included₹2199₹270019% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowSenior Citizen Health Checkup - FemaleIdeal for individuals aged 60 - 100 years134 tests included₹3999₹500020% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowActive Professional Health CheckupIdeal for individuals aged 41 - 60 years100 tests included₹1999₹240017% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowAdvanced Young Indian Health CheckupIdeal for individuals aged 21 - 40 years63 tests included₹1799₹280036% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowComprehensive Young Indian Health CheckupIdeal for individuals aged 21 - 40 years106 tests included₹2999₹390023% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowYoung Indian Health CheckupIdeal for individuals aged 21 - 40 years60 tests included₹749₹115035% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowVitamin Deficiency Health CheckupIdeal for individuals aged 11 - 80 years5 tests included₹1099₹150027% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowMen's Cancer Marker CheckupIdeal for individuals aged 21 - 80 years6 tests included₹2199₹270019% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowThousands of Happy Customers“Very professional phlebo.

This test helps to determine different phases of Hepatitis B infection and in monitoring response to treatment.What is Hepatitis B Infection and Hepatitis B Surface Antigen?Hepatitis B infection is an infection of the liver caused by the hepatitis B virus (HBV). This infection can spread from one person to another through contact with infected blood and body fluids. Common symptoms of this infection are dark urine, fatigue, fever, abdominal discomfort, weakness, loss of appetite, yellowing of eyes, joint and muscle pain. Symptoms usually appear in about one to four months after the occurrence of infection.Normally in most of the cases, this infection does not last for a long time. Your immune system fights it off within a few months. However, if you have it for more than six months, you are called a carrier. Mostly, adults may recover from this infection completely within a short period of time. Infants and children are more likely to develop a long-lasting infection.Hepatitis B virus (HBV) has proteins on its surface. These proteins are called hepatitis B surface antigens. It is found in your blood within several weeks (4 weeks) after the infection starts. Presence of hepatitis B surface antigens causes the immune system to make antibodies. Therefore, the hepatitis B surface antigens are the first marker for determining the presence of Hepatitis B infection.Why this test is performed?This test is performed to assess the HBsAg levels during the phases of Hepatitis B infection. It is not recommended as an initial diagnostic test for Hepatitis B infection. This test helps to assess the HBsAg levels during the phases of Hepatitis B infection. This test in combination with other Hepatitis B virus DNA tests helps the doctor to evaluate and monitor individuals receiving treatment for Hepatitis B infection.
