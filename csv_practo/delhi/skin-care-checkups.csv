Vitamin Profile,Vitamin Profile Blood,1200,"What is Vitamin Profile? Vitamins and minerals are essential nutrients for human life. Unhealthy eating habits and adulteration of food can lead to depletion of these vital nutrients and limit the ability of our body to fight against infections. This profile is specially designed to test as: 1. 25-OH VITAMIN D (TOTAL), 2. CALCIUM, 3. FOLATE, 4. THYROID STIMULATING HORMONE (TSH), 5. VITAMIN B-12. Why is Vitamin Profile done?If you have symptoms of vitamin D deficiency like bone malformation in children (rickets), bone weakness, or fractures in adults (osteomalacia)If you have risk factors for vitamin D deficiency like old age, limited sun exposure, obesity, or you have undergone gastric bypass surgery If you have symptoms of anemia like weakness, tiredness, pale skin (deficiency of B12), or folic acid deficiencyIf you have symptoms or signs of nerve problems like numbness, burning in hands, feet, arms, tingling sensation which may be due to vitamin B12 deficiencyWhat does Vitamin Profile Measure? For healthy living, vitamins play a very important role. However, any deficiency or increased presence of these vitamins are not good for health. The deficiency of vitamins can be due to not taking proper diet while excess can be due to excessive supplementation. Vitamins are classified as Water soluble and Fat-soluble vitamins.Fat-soluble vitamins include: Vitamin A, K, D, and EWater-soluble vitamins include Vitamin B-1 (Thiamine), B-2 (Riboflavin), B-3 (Niacin), B-5 (Pantothenic acid), B-6 (Pyridoxine), B-7 (Biotin), B-9 (Folate), B-12 (Cobalamin), and  Vitamin C. The most common vitamins which are found deficient include Vitamin D, Vitamin B12, and Vitamin B9. Vitamin D helps our body absorb calcium and phosphorus, and maintain strong bones and teeth. Vitamin D (25-OH) test measures the level of Vitamin D (25-OH) in the blood which is a useful indicator of osteoporosis (bone weakness), rickets (bone malformation), and osteomalacia.Vitamin B12 is also called Cobalamin. It is a water-soluble vitamin. Vitamin B12 plays an important role in the formation of normal red blood cells, repair of tissues, DNA synthesis, and genetic material in cells. It is not produced in the body and has to be taken in the diet. The diet sources which includes Vitamin B12 are red meat, fish, milk, poultry, yogurt, eggs, fortified cereals, bread, and other grain products. It can also be taken in the form of Vitamin B12 tablets or multivitamin pills. Low levels of Vitamin B12 results in macrocytic anemia (size of red blood cells larger than normal).Vitamin B9 along with Vitamin B12 and iron plays an important role in the formation of red blood cells. It plays an important role in the functioning of nerves and cell replication in the body. In pregnant ladies, it is required for proper development of fetus spinal cord. Low levels of Vitamin B9 can lead to anemia.Test PreparationInform your doctor if you are on any medications, have any allergies or underlying medical conditions before your Vitamin Profile.

The deficiency of vitamins can be due to not taking proper diet while excess can be due to excessive supplementation. Vitamins are classified as Water soluble and Fat-soluble vitamins.Fat-soluble vitamins include: Vitamin A, K, D, and EWater-soluble vitamins include Vitamin B-1 (Thiamine), B-2 (Riboflavin), B-3 (Niacin), B-5 (Pantothenic acid), B-6 (Pyridoxine), B-7 (Biotin), B-9 (Folate), B-12 (Cobalamin), and  Vitamin C. The most common vitamins which are found deficient include Vitamin D, Vitamin B12, and Vitamin B9. Vitamin D helps our body absorb calcium and phosphorus, and maintain strong bones and teeth. Vitamin D (25-OH) test measures the level of Vitamin D (25-OH) in the blood which is a useful indicator of osteoporosis (bone weakness), rickets (bone malformation), and osteomalacia.Vitamin B12 is also called Cobalamin. It is a water-soluble vitamin. Vitamin B12 plays an important role in the formation of normal red blood cells, repair of tissues, DNA synthesis, and genetic material in cells. It is not produced in the body and has to be taken in the diet. The diet sources which includes Vitamin B12 are red meat, fish, milk, poultry, yogurt, eggs, fortified cereals, bread, and other grain products. It can also be taken in the form of Vitamin B12 tablets or multivitamin pills. Low levels of Vitamin B12 results in macrocytic anemia (size of red blood cells larger than normal).Vitamin B9 along with Vitamin B12 and iron plays an important role in the formation of red blood cells. It plays an important role in the functioning of nerves and cell replication in the body. In pregnant ladies, it is required for proper development of fetus spinal cord. Low levels of Vitamin B9 can lead to anemia.Test PreparationInform your doctor if you are on any medications, have any allergies or underlying medical conditions before your Vitamin Profile.

T3 T4 TSH,Thyroid Profile Total Blood,400,"Thyroid Function Test panel measures the levels of total thyroxine T-4, total triiodothyronine T-3 and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) in blood. What is Thyroid Stimulating Hormone?The thyroid stimulating hormone is a pituitary hormone that stimulates the thyroid gland to produce triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4) hormones. These hormones help to control the rate at which energy is used in almost every tissue in the body.What are T4 and T3 Hormones?Thyroxine (T4) and Triiodothyronine (T3) which are secreted into the blood binds reversibly to the transport proteins like thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG), thyroxine binding prealbumin (TBPA), and albumin. Remaining unbound T4 and T3 circulates freely in blood and used by the body. This freely circulating Thyroxine (T4) and Triiodothyronine (T3) are known as Free Thyroxine FT-4 and Free triiodothyronine FT-3.What are Hyper and Hypothyroidism?This test is performed to measure whether the thyroid gland is hyperactive (Hyperthyroidism) or underactive (Hypothyroidism). Hyperthyroidism is a condition in which thyroid gland produces excessive hormones. This condition may cause signs and symptoms such as weight loss, irritability, sweating, and irregular heartbeats. Hypothyroidism is a condition in which thyroid gland does not produce enough hormones. This condition may cause weight gain, dry skin, constipation, feeling cold and slow heart rate. Your doctor may ask you to undergo this test if you exhibit any of these signs or symptoms.Why This Test is Done?The doctor may ask to get this test done if the patient is suffering from symptoms like unexplained weight loss or weight gain, fatigue, weakness, difficulty in concentrating which are common symptoms of thyroid disorders. In some cases, this test is performed to find out the effectiveness of the treatment. If a patient is on the treatment of artificial thyroid hormones then the doctor prefers this test to evaluate and to check the thyroid hormone levels in the body. This helps the doctor to rule out the patient’s disease condition.Precautions:Drugs like amiodarone, thiourea, lithium, phenylbutazone, sulfonamides and birth control pills may change the levels of Total Thyroxine T4 in the blood. Drugs like carbimazole, methimazole may affect the levels of TSH in blood. Hence, all medications should be reported to the doctor before undergoing this test.During pregnancy, T3, T4 levels may be abnormal and usually, it becomes stabilized after a period of time.Pathology test parameters:The Thyroid Profile Total test has the following components i.e:- Total Thyroxine T4, Total Triiodothyronine T3, and Thyroid Stimulating Hormone TSH.Also known as Thyroid Function Tests Total Blood, TFT Total Blood, TFT Total, Thyroid Function Tests Total.Test PreparationInform your doctor if you are on any medications, have any allergies or underlying medical conditions before your T3 T4 TSH. Your doctor will give specific instructions depending on your condition on how to prepare for T3 T4 TSH.There are no specific preparations required for the Thyroid Profile Total test.Understanding your test resultsIf the test results are in normal range then the thyroid gland is functioning normally and no need for further medical intervention.In the case of increased T3 and T4 levels in the blood than the normal range then it may be due to transient hyperthyroidism, Hashimoto's thyroiditis (an auto-immune disorder where the immune system of own body attacks the thyroid gland and decreases the production of hormones that are required for the body), Grave’s disease (an immune system disorder which results in the overproduction of thyroid hormones), subacute thyroiditis (acute inflammation of the thyroid gland), toxic adenoma (increased hormone production from single large nodule/lump in the thyroid gland), toxic multinodular goiter, thyroid cancer, increased production of thyroid stimulating hormone.If the levels of T4 and T3 are less than the normal range then it may be due to hypothyroidism, previous treatment of hyperthyroidism, subacute thyroiditis (acute inflammation of the thyroid gland), neck radiotherapy before the test, iodine deficiency or excessive iodine, pituitary dysfunction, idiopathic myxedema (severe hypothyroidism), tissue resistance to thyroid hormone, starvation, or long-term illness, etc.If TSH levels alone increased and T4, T3 levels are within the range then it may be due to mild hypothyroidism.In case of reduced levels of TSH, it may indicate hyperthyroidism. If all the three TSH, T4 and T3 levels are low then it may be caused by nonthyroidal illness or pituitary hypothyroidism.GenderAge groupsValueUNISEXAll age groups80 - 200ng/dlUNISEXAll age groups4.5 - 11.7 mcg/dlUNISEXAll age groups0.3 - 5U/mlYour Cart0 TestsProceed to CheckoutPopular Health Checkup PackagesFeatured CheckupsDiabetes CareWomen's HealthMen's HealthActive Professional Health CheckupIdeal for individuals aged 41 - 60 years100 tests included₹1999₹240017% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowAdvanced Young Indian Health CheckupIdeal for individuals aged 21 - 40 years63 tests included₹1799₹280036% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowComprehensive Young Indian Health CheckupIdeal for individuals aged 21 - 40 years106 tests included₹2999₹390023% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowWorking Women's Health CheckupIdeal for individuals aged 21 - 40 years66 tests included₹1799₹330045% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowYoung Indian Health CheckupIdeal for individuals aged 21 - 40 years60 tests included₹749₹115035% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowAdvanced Diabetic Patient's Health CheckupIdeal for individuals aged 35 - 85 years89 tests included₹3599₹500028% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowAdvanced Diabetic Screening CheckupIdeal for individuals aged 35 - 85 years70 tests included₹2199₹300027% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowBasic Diabetic Screening CheckupIdeal for individuals aged 20 - 40 years66 tests included₹1599₹200020% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowDiabetic Patient's Health CheckupIdeal for individuals aged 35 - 85 years77 tests included₹2799₹400030% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowWorking Women's Health CheckupIdeal for individuals aged 21 - 40 years66 tests included₹1799₹330045% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowVitamin Deficiency Health CheckupIdeal for individuals aged 11 - 80 years5 tests included₹1099₹150027% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowWomen's PCOD Detection CheckupIdeal for individuals aged 18 - 45 years37 tests included₹1799₹250028% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowWomen's Skincare CheckupIdeal for individuals aged 15 - 60 years44 tests included₹3499₹550036% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowWomen's Cancer Marker CheckupIdeal for individuals aged 21 - 80 years6 tests included₹2199₹270019% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowSenior Citizen Health Checkup - FemaleIdeal for individuals aged 60 - 100 years134 tests included₹3999₹500020% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowActive Professional Health CheckupIdeal for individuals aged 41 - 60 years100 tests included₹1999₹240017% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowAdvanced Young Indian Health CheckupIdeal for individuals aged 21 - 40 years63 tests included₹1799₹280036% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowComprehensive Young Indian Health CheckupIdeal for individuals aged 21 - 40 years106 tests included₹2999₹390023% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowYoung Indian Health CheckupIdeal for individuals aged 21 - 40 years60 tests included₹749₹115035% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowVitamin Deficiency Health CheckupIdeal for individuals aged 11 - 80 years5 tests included₹1099₹150027% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowMen's Cancer Marker CheckupIdeal for individuals aged 21 - 80 years6 tests included₹2199₹270019% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowThousands of Happy Customers“Very professional phlebo.

What is Thyroid Stimulating Hormone?The thyroid stimulating hormone is a pituitary hormone that stimulates the thyroid gland to produce triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4) hormones. These hormones help to control the rate at which energy is used in almost every tissue in the body.What are T4 and T3 Hormones?Thyroxine (T4) and Triiodothyronine (T3) which are secreted into the blood binds reversibly to the transport proteins like thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG), thyroxine binding prealbumin (TBPA), and albumin. Remaining unbound T4 and T3 circulates freely in blood and used by the body. This freely circulating Thyroxine (T4) and Triiodothyronine (T3) are known as Free Thyroxine FT-4 and Free triiodothyronine FT-3.What are Hyper and Hypothyroidism?This test is performed to measure whether the thyroid gland is hyperactive (Hyperthyroidism) or underactive (Hypothyroidism). Hyperthyroidism is a condition in which thyroid gland produces excessive hormones. This condition may cause signs and symptoms such as weight loss, irritability, sweating, and irregular heartbeats. Hypothyroidism is a condition in which thyroid gland does not produce enough hormones. This condition may cause weight gain, dry skin, constipation, feeling cold and slow heart rate. Your doctor may ask you to undergo this test if you exhibit any of these signs or symptoms.Why This Test is Done?The doctor may ask to get this test done if the patient is suffering from symptoms like unexplained weight loss or weight gain, fatigue, weakness, difficulty in concentrating which are common symptoms of thyroid disorders. In some cases, this test is performed to find out the effectiveness of the treatment. If a patient is on the treatment of artificial thyroid hormones then the doctor prefers this test to evaluate and to check the thyroid hormone levels in the body. This helps the doctor to rule out the patient’s disease condition.Precautions:Drugs like amiodarone, thiourea, lithium, phenylbutazone, sulfonamides and birth control pills may change the levels of Total Thyroxine T4 in the blood. Drugs like carbimazole, methimazole may affect the levels of TSH in blood. Hence, all medications should be reported to the doctor before undergoing this test.During pregnancy, T3, T4 levels may be abnormal and usually, it becomes stabilized after a period of time.Pathology test parameters:The Thyroid Profile Total test has the following components i.e:- Total Thyroxine T4, Total Triiodothyronine T3, and Thyroid Stimulating Hormone TSH.Also known as Thyroid Function Tests Total Blood, TFT Total Blood, TFT Total, Thyroid Function Tests Total.Test PreparationInform your doctor if you are on any medications, have any allergies or underlying medical conditions before your T3 T4 TSH.
