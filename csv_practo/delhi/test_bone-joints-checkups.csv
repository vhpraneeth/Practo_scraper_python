Vitamin Profile,Vitamin Profile Blood,,"What is Vitamin Profile? Vitamins and minerals are essential nutrients for human life. Unhealthy eating habits and adulteration of food can lead to depletion of these vital nutrients and limit the ability of our body to fight against infections. This profile is specially designed to test as: 1. 25-OH VITAMIN D (TOTAL), 2. CALCIUM, 3. FOLATE, 4. THYROID STIMULATING HORMONE (TSH), 5. VITAMIN B-12. Why is Vitamin Profile done?If you have symptoms of vitamin D deficiency like bone malformation in children (rickets), bone weakness, or fractures in adults (osteomalacia)If you have risk factors for vitamin D deficiency like old age, limited sun exposure, obesity, or you have undergone gastric bypass surgery If you have symptoms of anemia like weakness, tiredness, pale skin (deficiency of B12), or folic acid deficiencyIf you have symptoms or signs of nerve problems like numbness, burning in hands, feet, arms, tingling sensation which may be due to vitamin B12 deficiencyWhat does Vitamin Profile Measure? For healthy living, vitamins play a very important role. However, any deficiency or increased presence of these vitamins are not good for health. The deficiency of vitamins can be due to not taking proper diet while excess can be due to excessive supplementation. Vitamins are classified as Water soluble and Fat-soluble vitamins.Fat-soluble vitamins include: Vitamin A, K, D, and EWater-soluble vitamins include Vitamin B-1 (Thiamine), B-2 (Riboflavin), B-3 (Niacin), B-5 (Pantothenic acid), B-6 (Pyridoxine), B-7 (Biotin), B-9 (Folate), B-12 (Cobalamin), and  Vitamin C. The most common vitamins which are found deficient include Vitamin D, Vitamin B12, and Vitamin B9. Vitamin D helps our body absorb calcium and phosphorus, and maintain strong bones and teeth. Vitamin D (25-OH) test measures the level of Vitamin D (25-OH) in the blood which is a useful indicator of osteoporosis (bone weakness), rickets (bone malformation), and osteomalacia.Vitamin B12 is also called Cobalamin. It is a water-soluble vitamin. Vitamin B12 plays an important role in the formation of normal red blood cells, repair of tissues, DNA synthesis, and genetic material in cells. It is not produced in the body and has to be taken in the diet. The diet sources which includes Vitamin B12 are red meat, fish, milk, poultry, yogurt, eggs, fortified cereals, bread, and other grain products. It can also be taken in the form of Vitamin B12 tablets or multivitamin pills. Low levels of Vitamin B12 results in macrocytic anemia (size of red blood cells larger than normal).Vitamin B9 along with Vitamin B12 and iron plays an important role in the formation of red blood cells. It plays an important role in the functioning of nerves and cell replication in the body. In pregnant ladies, it is required for proper development of fetus spinal cord. Low levels of Vitamin B9 can lead to anemia.Test PreparationInform your doctor if you are on any medications, have any allergies or underlying medical conditions before your Vitamin Profile.

The diet sources which includes Vitamin B12 are red meat, fish, milk, poultry, yogurt, eggs, fortified cereals, bread, and other grain products. It can also be taken in the form of Vitamin B12 tablets or multivitamin pills. Low levels of Vitamin B12 results in macrocytic anemia (size of red blood cells larger than normal).Vitamin B9 along with Vitamin B12 and iron plays an important role in the formation of red blood cells. It plays an important role in the functioning of nerves and cell replication in the body. In pregnant ladies, it is required for proper development of fetus spinal cord. Low levels of Vitamin B9 can lead to anemia.","Inform your doctor if you are on any medications, have any allergies or underlying medical conditions before your Vitamin Profile.

PTH,Parathyroid Hormone Blood,₹800,"This test is used to investigate the levels of parathyroid hormone (PTH) in the blood sample of an individual. The parathyroid hormone is responsible for maintaining the normal levels of calcium and Vitamin D in the body. What is parathyroid?The parathyroid hormone regulates the levels of calcium in the body. It is produced by 4 parathyroid glands which are located behind the thyroid gland in the neck. Low levels of calcium in the body stimulate the release of calcium into the blood and absorption of vitamin D from the intestines and the release of the parathyroid hormone will be reduced in the presence of high amounts of calcium in the blood which increases the level of calcium excreted through urine or vice-versa.  The levels of parathyroid hormone are evaluated along with other parameters like serum electrolytes ( phosphorus, magnesium), vitamin D, calcium levels in urine and blood.Why is this test recommended?This test is recommended by the doctor if an individual has signs or symptoms of calcium deficiency like weakness, nausea, muscle pain, tingly feeling of hands and feet, pain in the abdomen, feeling of thirst, irregular heartbeat, weak bones, etc.This test can also be recommended by the doctor if an individual is suffering from certain diseases or conditions like hyperparathyroidism, Vitamin D deficiency, tumors of the thyroid, acute or chronic kidney diseases, etc.Also known as PTH Blood, Parathormone Blood, Parathormone, Parathyroid Hormone.Test PreparationInform your doctor if you are on any medications, have any allergies or underlying medical conditions before your PTH.

Calcium,Calcium Ion Specific Electrode Potentiometric Method Blood,₹200,"This test is used to find out the both bound and unbound calcium levels in the blood. Bound calcium is that the calcium attached to the other anions and to proteins like albumin. Unbound calcium is calcium that is not bounded to proteins and freely circulating in the blood. Unbound calcium is also known as ionized calcium or free calcium.What is Calcium?Calcium is one of the important minerals present in the body. It is naturally presented in the food items like cheese, almonds, beans, yogurt, seeds, milk, cereals, fruit juices, fish with soft bones etc. It is important for the body to maintain the strong bones and to carry out many functions in the body. It is required for muscles to move and for nerves to carry the messages between the brain and the body parts. This also helps the blood vessels to move blood throughout the body. It also has a role in the release of hormones and enzymes that affect most of the functions in the human body.Most of the calcium in the body is stored in the bones. Calcium metabolism is regulated by the parathyroid hormone (PTH)-vitamin D endocrine system. The active form of vitamin-d is calcitriol and it stimulates the calcium absorption from the gut. Absorption of calcium is done by active transport and passive diffusion. Active transport is dependent on the action of calcitriol and vitamin-d receptors (VDR). Active transport occurs primarily in the duodenum where VDR presents high in concentration. Passive diffusion involves the movement of calcium between mucosal cells. It depends on the electrochemical gradients and occurs throughout the intestine. Active transport of calcium occurs when there is a low or moderate intake of calcium. Passive diffusion takes place during high calcium intakes. Calcium is mainly excreted through urine and feces and sweat. Calcium is reabsorbed in the urinary tract and the excreted calcium through feces is unabsorbed intestinal calcium.Calcium is an important component of the skeleton and is necessary for its structure, tissue rigidity, strength, and elasticity. Calcium is needed for bone formation and resorption. Bone marrow cavity acts as a major site for the red blood cell production and immune system. So, to maintain healthy bone marrows calcium is needed for bones. Calcium is preserved within the non-bone tissues of the body by bones undergoing constant remodeling through bone resorption. Calcium helps to maintain acid-base balance in the blood. It also maintains healthy blood pressure. It is also used to treat osteoporosis which is a disease of the bones where bones become fragile and easy to break. It as lowers the risk of developing a colon or rectum cancer and prostate cancer.","The Calcium Blood Test is done to know whether an individual is having normal or abnormal calcium levels in the blood of the body. The doctor may ask to perform this test if an individual is suffering from conditions like hypercalcemia (high levels of calcium in the blood), hypocalcemia (low levels of calcium in the blood), osteoarthritis, osteoporosis, kidney stones, malformation of the skeleton. This test is also done to determine the risk of developing a bone disorder. If an individual is on the treatment of anti-diuretic medications like hydrochlorothiazide, chlorthalidone etc., then the doctor may ask to perform this test to evaluate and to check the effectiveness of the treatment and calcium levels in the body. This helps the doctor to rule out the patient disease condition. If an individual is suffering from symptoms like muscle cramps, lethargy, dermatitis, mental confusion, weakness then the doctor may ask to do the Calcium Blood Test. The doctor may recommend this test for pregnant women to check the possibilities of occurrence of pre-eclampsia (pregnancy complication characterized by high blood pressure).Generally, when a patient is diagnosed with kidney failure, arthritis or malnutrition visits hospital for a general check-up, the doctor may ask to undergo the Calcium blood test which gives a better status of the condition. This test is also performed to provide a clear idea regarding the malnutrition of an individual and kidney dysfunction.

Bound calcium is that the calcium attached to the other anions and to proteins like albumin. Unbound calcium is calcium that is not bounded to proteins and freely circulating in the blood. Unbound calcium is also known as ionized calcium or free calcium.What is Calcium?Calcium is one of the important minerals present in the body. It is naturally presented in the food items like cheese, almonds, beans, yogurt, seeds, milk, cereals, fruit juices, fish with soft bones etc. It is important for the body to maintain the strong bones and to carry out many functions in the body. It is required for muscles to move and for nerves to carry the messages between the brain and the body parts. This also helps the blood vessels to move blood throughout the body. It also has a role in the release of hormones and enzymes that affect most of the functions in the human body.Most of the calcium in the body is stored in the bones. Calcium metabolism is regulated by the parathyroid hormone (PTH)-vitamin D endocrine system. The active form of vitamin-d is calcitriol and it stimulates the calcium absorption from the gut. Absorption of calcium is done by active transport and passive diffusion. Active transport is dependent on the action of calcitriol and vitamin-d receptors (VDR). Active transport occurs primarily in the duodenum where VDR presents high in concentration. Passive diffusion involves the movement of calcium between mucosal cells. It depends on the electrochemical gradients and occurs throughout the intestine. Active transport of calcium occurs when there is a low or moderate intake of calcium. Passive diffusion takes place during high calcium intakes. Calcium is mainly excreted through urine and feces and sweat. Calcium is reabsorbed in the urinary tract and the excreted calcium through feces is unabsorbed intestinal calcium.Calcium is an important component of the skeleton and is necessary for its structure, tissue rigidity, strength, and elasticity. Calcium is needed for bone formation and resorption. Bone marrow cavity acts as a major site for the red blood cell production and immune system. So, to maintain healthy bone marrows calcium is needed for bones. Calcium is preserved within the non-bone tissues of the body by bones undergoing constant remodeling through bone resorption. Calcium helps to maintain acid-base balance in the blood. It also maintains healthy blood pressure. It is also used to treat osteoporosis which is a disease of the bones where bones become fragile and easy to break. It as lowers the risk of developing a colon or rectum cancer and prostate cancer.Why this test is performed?The Calcium Blood Test is done to know whether an individual is having normal or abnormal calcium levels in the blood of the body. The doctor may ask to perform this test if an individual is suffering from conditions like hypercalcemia (high levels of calcium in the blood), hypocalcemia (low levels of calcium in the blood), osteoarthritis, osteoporosis, kidney stones, malformation of the skeleton. This test is also done to determine the risk of developing a bone disorder. If an individual is on the treatment of anti-diuretic medications like hydrochlorothiazide, chlorthalidone etc., then the doctor may ask to perform this test to evaluate and to check the effectiveness of the treatment and calcium levels in the body. This helps the doctor to rule out the patient disease condition. If an individual is suffering from symptoms like muscle cramps, lethargy, dermatitis, mental confusion, weakness then the doctor may ask to do the Calcium Blood Test. The doctor may recommend this test for pregnant women to check the possibilities of occurrence of pre-eclampsia (pregnancy complication characterized by high blood pressure).Generally, when a patient is diagnosed with kidney failure, arthritis or malnutrition visits hospital for a general check-up, the doctor may ask to undergo the Calcium blood test which gives a better status of the condition. This test is also performed to provide a clear idea regarding the malnutrition of an individual and kidney dysfunction.

Magnesium Test,Magnesium Blood,₹200,"This test is used to find out the Magnesium levels in the blood. What is Magnesium?Magnesium Mg is a  macro-mineral which is naturally presented in many food items like milk, peanut butter, spinach, banana, beans etc. It is also available in some medicines and added to other food products as dietary supplements. The average human body contains about 25 grams of Magnesium Mg. Magnesium regulates the electrolyte balance in the body and also protects the DNA. It also helps in the production and synthesis of ATP which acts as a fuel to the cell. Mg is also a cofactor in more than 300 enzyme systems. These enzyme systems regulate the diverse biochemical reactions in the body. Mg plays an important in the protein synthesis, blood pressure regulation, blood glucose control and in the nerve and muscle functions.Magnesium Mg plays an important role in the relaying signals between the brain and the body. It acts as a gatekeeper for the NMDA receptors which are found on the nerve cells and helps in brain development, learning, and memory. It also helps in maintaining a healthy heart rate by competing with the calcium which enters the heart for stimulating the contraction of the heart. Magnesium acts as natural calcium blocker and helps muscle cells to relax after contraction. Magnesium also helps to lower the blood pressure and reduce the risk of heart disease. It provides health benefits like reducing the symptoms of depression and improving sleep quality.","The Magnesium Blood Test is done to know whether an individual is having normal or abnormal magnesium levels in the blood of the body.

Phosphorus,Phosphorus Automated Blood,,"Phosphorus - Blood test is used to measure the phosphorus levels in the blood. What is Phosphorus?Phosphorus (P) is a mineral which is naturally present in many food items such as meat and dairy products that we eat. It is mainly present in your bones and teeth. It is also found within the cells throughout the body. The body needs phosphorus for bone growth, energy storage, and muscle and nerve function. It gets absorbed through small intestines and removed via the kidneys. The total body phosphate levels in the blood are about 1 percent in normal health condition. ","The Phosphorus Blood Test is performed to know whether an individual is having normal or abnormal phosphorus levels in the blood. Your doctor may ask to perform this test if you experience any signs and symptoms of hypophosphatemia (low levels of phosphorus in the blood) such as loss of appetite, bone pain, changes in mental state, poor bone development in children, irregular breathing, muscle weakness, weight gain or loss etc. This test is also recommended to you by your doctor if he suspects a condition called hyperphosphatemia (High levels of phosphorus in the blood). You may be advised to perform this test if you have a kidney disorder, diabetes, or if you are taking phosphate or calcium supplements. Your doctor may also recommend this test in individuals who had shown an abnormal calcium level as part of a follow-up test. However, in case of abnormal test results, your doctor may recommend a few more additional tests to detect the exact cause of abnormal test results.If you have a family history of kidney problems, your doctor may ask you to perform this test on a 6-monthly basis or a yearly basis. Patients with kidney disorders or conditions such as hypophosphatemia or hyperphosphatemia should perform this test on a regular basis, as instructed by the doctor.Precautions:Medications such as antacids, intravenous glucose, or Vitamin D supplements may change the levels of phosphorus in the blood. So inform your doctor prior to the test if you are on these medications.Also known as Inorganic Phosphorus Automated Blood, Serum Inorganic Phosphorus Automated Blood, Serum Phosphorus Automated Blood, Sr. Phosphorous Automated Blood, Inorganic Phosphorus, Serum Inorganic Phosphorus, Serum Phosphorus, Sr. Phosphorous.Test PreparationInform your doctor if you are on any medications, have any allergies or underlying medical conditions before your Phosphorus. Your doctor will give specific instructions depending on your condition on how to prepare for Phosphorus.No specific preparation is required for this test. However, follow all the instructions given by your healthcare provider.Understanding your test resultsIf the test results fall in the normal reference range generally no medical intervention is necessary.If the test result shows high levels of phosphorus in the blood, the condition is called hyperphosphatemia. High levels of phosphorus may indicate kidney failure, liver disease, hypoparathyroidism (a condition due to low levels of parathyroid hormone), diabetic ketoacidosis (a complication of diabetes where the body produces high levels of ketones in the blood), hypocalcemia (a condition due to low levels of calcium in the blood) etc. Increased levels of phosphorus may also be seen in individuals taking phosphate or vitamin D supplements or who take medicines containing phosphates. If the test result shows low levels of phosphorus in the blood, the condition is called hypophosphatemia. Low levels of phosphorus may indicate nutritional problems due to lack of sufficient phosphorus in diet or medical conditions such as hyperparathyroidism (a condition due to high levels of parathyroid hormone), hypercalcemia (a condition due to high levels of calcium in the blood), severe burns, hypokalemia (low levels of potassium in the blood), rickets and osteomalacia (deficiency disorder due to the lack of vitamin D). Decreased levels of phosphorus may also be seen in individuals consuming alcohol or who take medicines such as diuretics, antacids etc. If you have higher or lower levels of phosphorus in the blood consult your doctor for further instructions.
