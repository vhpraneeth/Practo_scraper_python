PTH,Parathyroid Hormone Blood,₹800,This test is used to investigate the levels of parathyroid hormone (PTH) in the blood sample of an individual. The parathyroid hormone is responsible for maintaining the normal levels of calcium and Vitamin D in the body.  ,"The parathyroid hormone regulates the levels of calcium in the body. It is produced by 4 parathyroid glands which are located behind the thyroid gland in the neck. Low levels of calcium in the body stimulate the release of calcium into the blood and absorption of vitamin D from the intestines and the release of the parathyroid hormone will be reduced in the presence of high amounts of calcium in the blood which increases the level of calcium excreted through urine or vice-versa.  The levels of parathyroid hormone are evaluated along with other parameters like serum electrolytes ( phosphorus, magnesium), vitamin D, calcium levels in urine and blood.",,"This test is recommended by the doctor if an individual has signs or symptoms of calcium deficiency like weakness, nausea, muscle pain, tingly feeling of hands and feet, pain in the abdomen, feeling of thirst, irregular heartbeat, weak bones, etc. ","Inform your doctor if you are on any medications, have any allergies or underlying medical conditions before your PTH. Your doctor will give specific instructions depending on your condition on how to prepare for PTH.","Increased serum levels indicate hyperactive parathyroid gland and the person may be suffering from hyperparathyroidism, parathyroid tumors or any other associated conditions of kidneys, brain or bone.
Lower levels of parathyroid hormone may indicate inadequate functioning of the parathyroid glands, obstruction, etc.
Appropriate treatments or diagnostic tests will be recommended by your doctor based on your test results.",https://www.practo.com/tests/parathyroid-hormone-blood/p?city=delhi

Calcium,Calcium Ion Specific Electrode Potentiometric Method Blood,₹200,This test is used to find out the both bound and unbound calcium levels in the blood. Bound calcium is that the calcium attached to the other anions and to proteins like albumin. Unbound calcium is calcium that is not bounded to proteins and freely circulating in the blood. Unbound calcium is also known as ionized calcium or free calcium. ?,"Calcium is one of the important minerals present in the body. It is naturally presented in the food items like cheese, almonds, beans, yogurt, seeds, milk, cereals, fruit juices, fish with soft bones etc. It is important for the body to maintain the strong bones and to carry out many functions in the body. It is required for muscles to move and for nerves to carry the messages between the brain and the body parts. This also helps the blood vessels to move blood throughout the body. It also has a role in the release of hormones and enzymes that affect most of the functions in the human body.",Most of the calcium in the body is stored in the bones. Calcium metabolism is regulated by the parathyroid hormone (PTH)-vitamin D endocrine system. The active form of vitamin-d is calcitriol and it stimulates the calcium absorption from the gut. Absorption of calcium is done by active transport and passive diffusion. Active transport is dependent on the action of calcitriol and vitamin-d receptors (VDR). Active transport occurs primarily in the duodenum where VDR presents high in concentration. Passive diffusion involves the movement of calcium between mucosal cells. It depends on the electrochemical gradients and occurs throughout the intestine. Active transport of calcium occurs when there is a low or moderate intake of calcium. Passive diffusion takes place during high calcium intakes. Calcium is mainly excreted through urine and feces and sweat. Calcium is reabsorbed in the urinary tract and the excreted calcium through feces is unabsorbed intestinal calcium.,"Calcium is an important component of the skeleton and is necessary for its structure, tissue rigidity, strength, and elasticity. Calcium is needed for bone formation and resorption. Bone marrow cavity acts as a major site for the red blood cell production and immune system. So, to maintain healthy bone marrows calcium is needed for bones. Calcium is preserved within the non-bone tissues of the body by bones undergoing constant remodeling through bone resorption. Calcium helps to maintain acid-base balance in the blood. It also maintains healthy blood pressure. It is also used to treat osteoporosis which is a disease of the bones where bones become fragile and easy to break. It as lowers the risk of developing a colon or rectum cancer and prostate cancer. ","Inform your doctor if you are on any medications, have any allergies or underlying medical conditions before your Calcium. Your doctor will give specific instructions depending on your condition on how to prepare for Calcium.","If test results are more than the normal range then it may indicate that there may be conditions likes kidney dysfunction or kidney failure, liver disease, hyperthyroidism, adrenal gland failure, sarcoidosis, hyperparathyroidism, T-cell lymphoma (Rare form of cancer that begins in the white blood cells and attacks the skin), multiple myeloma (rare form of cancer in plasma cells), metastatic bone tumour (a form of cancer that starts in bones and may spread to lung and kidneys), paget disease (failure of replacement of old bone tissues with new bone tissues), high consumption of calcium msupplements, hypercalcemia (high levels of calcium levels in the blood), parathyroid tumour (cancer in the parathyroid gland), intense thirst, bone pains, tiredness, vomiting, weakness, decreased apetite (decreased derire to eat), abdominal pain, overuse of antacids, tuberculosis (bacterial infection of the lungs and also known as TB), prolonged immobilization (increased bed rest without moving), constipation (difficulty in emptying bowel or hardened feces), kidney transplant, high vitamin-D in diet.",https://www.practo.com/tests/calcium-ion-specific-electrode-potentiometric-method-blood/p?city=delhi
