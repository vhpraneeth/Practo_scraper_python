HbA1c Test,Glycosylated Haemoglobin Blood,₹300,HbA1c is used to measure the amount of blood sugar (glucose) attached to hemoglobin over 3 months. This combination of hemoglobin and glucose is called HbA1c. Hemoglobin is a component of red blood cells which carry oxygen from the lungs to the whole body. HbA1c test shows the average amount of glucose present in hemoglobin for 3 months. It is usually done once in three months because typically lifespan of a red blood cell is 3 months.It is used to check for diabetes or prediabetes in adults. Prediabetes indicates that you are at the risk of getting diabetes. If you are already a diabetic patient then it will help you in regulating glucose levels. ,"This test may be recommended to you by your doctor if you have symptoms of diabetes like blurred vision, increased urination, increased thirst, fatigue. Your doctor may also recommend this test if you are at risk of having diabetes. These symptoms include high blood pressure, history of heart disease, overweight or obese, less physical activity. ",If you are diabetic HbA1c test should be done once every three months.  But it may be needed more if you are planning to have a baby or your treatment has changed recently or if you have problems controlling your blood sugar levels.,"HbA1c test results may be altered by different disease conditions like anemia or other blood disorders like thalassemia, kidney disease, or liver disease. Hence inform your doctor or technician about your current medical conditions and medications, especially vitamin C and vitamin E supplements, atorvastatin. HbA1c test results are also altered by your habits like smoking, opium and substance abuse. Temperature also alters the HbA1c levels, mostly during winter and cold conditions there may be chances of the high level of HbA1c.The HbA1c test is not recommended for gestational diabetes. Gestational diabetes is a type of diabetes that affects only pregnant women. It is also not recommended for diagnosing diabetes in children.Also known as Glycosylated Hb Blood, Diabetes test, Glycosylated Hemoglobin test, A1C Test, Hemoglobin A1C Test, Diabetes Test HbA1c, A1C Hemoglobin Test, Glycosylated Haemoglobin, Glycosylated Hb, H1c Test.","Inform your doctor if you are on any medications, have any allergies or underlying medical conditions before your HbA1c Test. Your doctor will give specific instructions depending on your condition on how to prepare for HbA1c Test.No specific preparation is required for HbA1c test.","Depending on your HbA1c test results your diabetic treatment plan is decided by your doctor. Since this test shows the results of three months, it shows how well the treatment is working, if you are already on diabetic treatment. If your HbA1c test results are slightly higher than normal value then it may indicate that you are in the prediabetic stage. If your HbA1c tests results are high, there may risk of certain diseases like heart disease, kidney disease, nerve damage, stroke or eye disease.If your HbA1c test results are higher than the normal range then it indicates that you are diabetic and need to control your blood sugar levels. If you are not on regular medication or if your blood sugars are not well maintained, then HbA1c test results show a higher value.Your doctor may have different recommendations for you keeping in mind your overall health, weight, age, and other factors.GenderAge groupsValueOTHERAll age groups<  5.7 is normal",https://www.practo.com/tests/glycosylated-haemoglobin-blood/p?city=ahmedabad
Insulin Fasting,Insulin Fasting Blood,₹500,"Insulin Fasting is a test that measures insulin levels in the blood after 8 hours of fasting or whole night fasting. What is Insulin?Insulin is a hormone produced by the beta cells in the pancreas. Insulin helps in absorption of glucose (sugar) from the bloodstream into the cells of the body. In these cells, glucose is used for the production of energy, which is utilized by the body. In healthy individuals, insulin production is high when the glucose levels in the blood are high and insulin production is low when the glucose levels in the blood are low.Insulin maintains blood glucose levels and prevents hypoglycemia (low blood sugar levels) as well as hyperglycemia (high blood sugar levels). Insulin converts the excess sugar in the blood into glycogen for storage.If insulin secretion is abnormal or if the body is unable to produce insulin, it may lead to an increase in the blood sugar levels; this may cause Diabetes mellitus. If the body is unable to produce insulin, it may lead to type 1 diabetes mellitus. If the body produces an insufficient amount of insulin or if the body cells are resistant to insulin, this may lead to type 2 diabetes mellitus.","Your doctor may ask you to perform this test if you are suffering from symptoms such as frequent urination, hunger, blurred vision, fatigue, increased thirst or dry mouth, unexplained weight loss or weight gain, poor wound healing, foot pain and numbness, frequent infections, itching around penis or vagina, sweating, fast heart rate, sleepiness, headache, nausea, vomiting, etc. which are common symptoms of diabetes mellitus. In some cases, such as the removal of an insulinoma (a tumor of the pancreas), your doctor may ask you to perform this test to determine the effectiveness of the treatment. This test may be performed either alone or in a combination with other tests for better diagnosis.This test is also done to understand whether an individual is having pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas), Cushing syndrome (pink and purple stretch marks along with round face and large tummy), acromegaly (enlargement of the face, hand, and feet), insulinomas (excess production of insulin due to tumor in the pancreas). If the patient exhibits symptoms of diabetes, the doctor may ask the patient to undergo insulin fasting test to determine the status of insulin secretion.Precautions:Medications such as corticosteroids, levodopa, oral contraceptives, etc. may alter the results of this test. Hence, it is advised that you report all your current medications to your healthcare practitioner before undergoing this test.","The frequency of this test depends on various factors like suspected diabetes mellitus, personal history of diabetes, family history of diabetes, body weight, history of heart disease, high blood pressure, gestational diabetes (high blood sugar levels during pregnancy), imbalance of female sex hormones, polycystic ovary disease, etc.","Medications such as corticosteroids, levodopa, oral contraceptives, etc. may alter the results of this test.

This test is used to monitor individuals with diabetes. Fasting blood sugar test is the most commonly prescribed test for diabetes and it is the simplest and fastest test.What is the importance of glucose?The main source of energy for all the cells in our body, mostly for brain cells comes from glucose. Glucose acts as a building block for carbohydrates. Carbohydrates are commonly found in rice, cereals, bread, fruit, or pasta. Carbohydrates are immediately converted to glucose, thus increasing the glucose levels in your blood. This condition is called diabetes.","This test may be recommended to you if you experience any of the symptoms like increase urge to urinate, blurred vision, recent weight gain, confusion, change in behavior, if you experience seizures for the first time, loss of consciousness, etc. Increase in your blood sugar levels and diabetes may not always show all the symptoms.Precautions:Some medicines may also alter your fasting blood sugar levels like contraceptive pills, diuretics like furosemide, torsemide, etc, if you are on hormone therapy, corticosteroids like prednisone, prednisolone, etc, aspirin, phenytoin, lithium, epinephrine, sulfonylurea drugs like glimepiride, glipizide etc, tricyclic antidepressants like amitriptyline, etc.Inform your doctor about your past illness or medications, about your present illness and current medication prior to the test.","For individuals above 45 years of age, this test is recommended every 3 years.

Lipid Profile,Lipid Profile Blood,₹400,"Lipid profile test is a set of tests used to measure the amount of cholesterol and other types of fats present in your blood. This test is helpful in assessing the risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Test parameters:HDL (High-density lipoproteins)LDL (Low-density lipoproteins)VLDL (Very low-density lipoproteins)Total cholesterolTriglyceridesWhat is the importance of lipids?Lipids are a bunch of fats and fat-like substances which are very useful constituents of the cells in our body. They are also an important source of energy. Cholesterol and triglycerides are the two important lipids. Cholesterol and triglycerides are transported are circulated into the blood through lipoprotein particles. Each lipoprotein particle is a combination of cholesterol, phospholipids, triglycerides and protein molecules. Types of lipoproteins?They are classified based on their density into three types. They are:HDL (High-density lipoproteins)LDL (Low-density lipoproteins)VLDL (Very low-density lipoproteins)Total cholesterolTriglyceridesHigh-density lipoproteins (HDL) are considered as good cholesterol and low-density lipoproteins (LDL) is considered as bad cholesterol. High-density cholesterol carries cholesterol to the liver from various parts of your body. Liver functions by eliminating the cholesterol out of the body.  HDL helps in moving the cholesterol away from your arteries. The increased amount of HDL helps in reducing the risk of coronary heart disease. LDL gets attached to the walls of arteries and clogs them. This leads to a condition called atherosclerosis. Total cholesterol is the sum of both HDL and LDL. With the help of total cholesterol and HDL the values, total cholesterol-to-HDL ratio can be derived with which coronary heart disease and stroke can be diagnosed.","The lipid profile test is done to know whether an individual is having normal or abnormal cholesterol levels in the body. The doctor may ask to perform this test if an individual is suffering from conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure and have heart disease or with a family history of heart disease, have a heart attack. This test is also done to determine the risk of developing heart disease. If an individual is on the treatment of anti-cholesterol medications like statins, then the doctor may ask to perform this test to evaluate and to check the effectiveness of the treatment and cholesterol levels in the body. This helps the doctor to rule out the patient disease condition. Generally, when a patient is diagnosed with atherosclerosis or hypercholesterolemia visits hospital for a general check-up, the doctor may ask to undergo the lipid profile test which gives a better status of the condition. Mostly, this test is done along with other tests like an electrocardiogram (ECG), echocardiogram, cardiac catheterization.Precautions:Smoking and medicines like statins (simvastatin, rosuvastatin) may change the levels of lipids in the blood.

This can be due to a poorly functioning pancreas, Type 1 diabetes, Type 2 diabetes, an adrenal gland disorder, or liver disease. This can also occur when the insulin production is suppressed by diabetes treatment with exogenous insulin. Decreased levels of C-peptide in individuals with insulinoma depicts a response to treatment.High levels of C-peptide may indicate a high level of insulin production in the body. This can be due to kidney disease, insulin resistance, or Cushing’s syndrome, an endocrine disorder in which the body makes too much cortisol. High levels of insulin are also seen in individuals with a condition called insulinomas. Insulinomas is a condition in which a tumor of islet cells in the pancreas overproduces insulin and C-peptide in the body resulting in acute episodes of hypoglycemia (low blood glucose levels). Symptoms of low blood glucose levels are increased hunger, sweating, nervousness, blurred vision, rapid or irregular heartbeat, fainting, confusion, seizures or loss of consciousness. Increased levels of C-peptide in individuals with insulinoma receiving treatment depicts a poor response to treatment or indicate a tumor recurrence.If you have higher or lower than normal levels of C-peptide, consult your doctor for further instructions.

T3 T4 TSH,Thyroid Profile Total Blood,₹400,"Thyroid Function Test panel measures the levels of total thyroxine T-4, total triiodothyronine T-3 and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) in blood. What is Thyroid Stimulating Hormone?The thyroid stimulating hormone is a pituitary hormone that stimulates the thyroid gland to produce triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4) hormones. These hormones help to control the rate at which energy is used in almost every tissue in the body.What are T4 and T3 Hormones?Thyroxine (T4) and Triiodothyronine (T3) which are secreted into the blood binds reversibly to the transport proteins like thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG), thyroxine binding prealbumin (TBPA), and albumin. Remaining unbound T4 and T3 circulates freely in blood and used by the body. This freely circulating Thyroxine (T4) and Triiodothyronine (T3) are known as Free Thyroxine FT-4 and Free triiodothyronine FT-3.What are Hyper and Hypothyroidism?This test is performed to measure whether the thyroid gland is hyperactive (Hyperthyroidism) or underactive (Hypothyroidism). Hyperthyroidism is a condition in which thyroid gland produces excessive hormones. This condition may cause signs and symptoms such as weight loss, irritability, sweating, and irregular heartbeats. Hypothyroidism is a condition in which thyroid gland does not produce enough hormones. This condition may cause weight gain, dry skin, constipation, feeling cold and slow heart rate. Your doctor may ask you to undergo this test if you exhibit any of these signs or symptoms.Why This Test is Done?The doctor may ask to get this test done if the patient is suffering from symptoms like unexplained weight loss or weight gain, fatigue, weakness, difficulty in concentrating which are common symptoms of thyroid disorders. In some cases, this test is performed to find out the effectiveness of the treatment. If a patient is on the treatment of artificial thyroid hormones then the doctor prefers this test to evaluate and to check the thyroid hormone levels in the body. This helps the doctor to rule out the patient’s disease condition.Precautions:Drugs like amiodarone, thiourea, lithium, phenylbutazone, sulfonamides and birth control pills may change the levels of Total Thyroxine T4 in the blood. Drugs like carbimazole, methimazole may affect the levels of TSH in blood. Hence, all medications should be reported to the doctor before undergoing this test.During pregnancy, T3, T4 levels may be abnormal and usually, it becomes stabilized after a period of time.Pathology test parameters:The Thyroid Profile Total test has the following components i.e:- Total Thyroxine T4, Total Triiodothyronine T3, and Thyroid Stimulating Hormone TSH.Also known as Thyroid Function Tests Total Blood, TFT Total Blood, TFT Total, Thyroid Function Tests Total.Test PreparationInform your doctor if you are on any medications, have any allergies or underlying medical conditions before your T3 T4 TSH. Your doctor will give specific instructions depending on your condition on how to prepare for T3 T4 TSH.There are no specific preparations required for the Thyroid Profile Total test.Understanding your test resultsIf the test results are in normal range then the thyroid gland is functioning normally and no need for further medical intervention.In the case of increased T3 and T4 levels in the blood than the normal range then it may be due to transient hyperthyroidism, Hashimoto's thyroiditis (an auto-immune disorder where the immune system of own body attacks the thyroid gland and decreases the production of hormones that are required for the body), Grave’s disease (an immune system disorder which results in the overproduction of thyroid hormones), subacute thyroiditis (acute inflammation of the thyroid gland), toxic adenoma (increased hormone production from single large nodule/lump in the thyroid gland), toxic multinodular goiter, thyroid cancer, increased production of thyroid stimulating hormone.If the levels of T4 and T3 are less than the normal range then it may be due to hypothyroidism, previous treatment of hyperthyroidism, subacute thyroiditis (acute inflammation of the thyroid gland), neck radiotherapy before the test, iodine deficiency or excessive iodine, pituitary dysfunction, idiopathic myxedema (severe hypothyroidism), tissue resistance to thyroid hormone, starvation, or long-term illness, etc.If TSH levels alone increased and T4, T3 levels are within the range then it may be due to mild hypothyroidism.In case of reduced levels of TSH, it may indicate hyperthyroidism. If all the three TSH, T4 and T3 levels are low then it may be caused by nonthyroidal illness or pituitary hypothyroidism.GenderAge groupsValueUNISEXAll age groups80 - 200ng/dlUNISEXAll age groups4.5 - 11.7 mcg/dlUNISEXAll age groups0.3 - 5U/mlYour Cart0 TestsProceed to CheckoutPopular Health Checkup PackagesFeatured CheckupsDiabetes CareWomen's HealthMen's HealthActive Professional Health CheckupIdeal for individuals aged 41 - 60 years78 tests included₹1999₹240017% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowAdvanced Young Indian Health CheckupIdeal for individuals aged 21 - 40 years63 tests included₹1799₹280036% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowComprehensive Active Professional Health CheckupIdeal for individuals aged 41 - 60 years90 tests included₹3499₹490029% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowComprehensive Young Indian Health CheckupIdeal for individuals aged 21 - 40 years84 tests included₹2999₹390023% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowWorking Women's Health CheckupIdeal for individuals aged 21 - 40 years66 tests included₹1799₹330045% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowYoung Indian Health CheckupIdeal for individuals aged 21 - 40 years60 tests included₹749₹115035% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowAdvanced Diabetic Patient's Health CheckupIdeal for individuals aged 35 - 85 years89 tests included₹3599₹500028% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowAdvanced Diabetic Screening CheckupIdeal for individuals aged 35 - 85 years70 tests included₹2199₹300027% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowBasic Diabetic Screening CheckupIdeal for individuals aged 20 - 40 years66 tests included₹1599₹200020% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowDiabetic Patient's Health CheckupIdeal for individuals aged 35 - 85 years77 tests included₹2799₹400030% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowWorking Women's Health CheckupIdeal for individuals aged 21 - 40 years66 tests included₹1799₹330045% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowVitamin Deficiency Health CheckupIdeal for individuals aged 11 - 80 years5 tests included₹1099₹150027% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowWomen's PCOD Detection CheckupIdeal for individuals aged 18 - 45 years37 tests included₹1799₹250028% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowWomen's Skincare CheckupIdeal for individuals aged 15 - 60 years44 tests included₹3499₹550036% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowActive Professional Health CheckupIdeal for individuals aged 41 - 60 years78 tests included₹1999₹240017% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowAdvanced Young Indian Health CheckupIdeal for individuals aged 21 - 40 years63 tests included₹1799₹280036% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowComprehensive Active Professional Health CheckupIdeal for individuals aged 41 - 60 years90 tests included₹3499₹490029% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowComprehensive Young Indian Health CheckupIdeal for individuals aged 21 - 40 years84 tests included₹2999₹390023% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowYoung Indian Health CheckupIdeal for individuals aged 21 - 40 years60 tests included₹749₹115035% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowVitamin Deficiency Health CheckupIdeal for individuals aged 11 - 80 years5 tests included₹1099₹150027% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowThousands of Happy Customers“Very professional phlebo.

What is Thyroid Stimulating Hormone?The thyroid stimulating hormone is a pituitary hormone that stimulates the thyroid gland to produce triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4) hormones. These hormones help to control the rate at which energy is used in almost every tissue in the body.What are T4 and T3 Hormones?Thyroxine (T4) and Triiodothyronine (T3) which are secreted into the blood binds reversibly to the transport proteins like thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG), thyroxine binding prealbumin (TBPA), and albumin. Remaining unbound T4 and T3 circulates freely in blood and used by the body. This freely circulating Thyroxine (T4) and Triiodothyronine (T3) are known as Free Thyroxine FT-4 and Free triiodothyronine FT-3.What are Hyper and Hypothyroidism?This test is performed to measure whether the thyroid gland is hyperactive (Hyperthyroidism) or underactive (Hypothyroidism). Hyperthyroidism is a condition in which thyroid gland produces excessive hormones. This condition may cause signs and symptoms such as weight loss, irritability, sweating, and irregular heartbeats. Hypothyroidism is a condition in which thyroid gland does not produce enough hormones. This condition may cause weight gain, dry skin, constipation, feeling cold and slow heart rate. Your doctor may ask you to undergo this test if you exhibit any of these signs or symptoms.Why This Test is Done?The doctor may ask to get this test done if the patient is suffering from symptoms like unexplained weight loss or weight gain, fatigue, weakness, difficulty in concentrating which are common symptoms of thyroid disorders. In some cases, this test is performed to find out the effectiveness of the treatment. If a patient is on the treatment of artificial thyroid hormones then the doctor prefers this test to evaluate and to check the thyroid hormone levels in the body. This helps the doctor to rule out the patient’s disease condition.Precautions:Drugs like amiodarone, thiourea, lithium, phenylbutazone, sulfonamides and birth control pills may change the levels of Total Thyroxine T4 in the blood.

Post Prandial Blood Sugar,Glucose Post Prandial Blood,₹150,"Postprandial blood sugar test is used to measure the amount of glucose present in our blood, after two hours of eating. This test indicates how your body responds to sugar and starch after you have a meal. Importance of Glucose:As the food gets digested the levels of blood glucose or blood sugar increase rapidly. The pancreas releases insulin in response to the elevated blood glucose levels to convert it into fuel. Within two hours of having a meal, insulin levels and glucose levels should get back to normal, but if your blood glucose levels remain high it may indicate the presence of diabetes.The main source of energy for all the cells in our body mostly for brain cells comes from glucose. Glucose acts as a building block for carbohydrates. Carbohydrates are commonly found in rice, cereals, bread, fruit or pasta.

LFT Test,Liver Function Tests Blood,₹400,"Liver function test is a set of blood tests used to monitor the working of the liver or to screen the liver damage or inflammation. This test helps in diagnosing a liver disease or liver condition. This test also measures the amount of certain enzymes and proteins in the blood. Some of these tests are helpful in estimating the performance of the liver functions like producing proteins, clearing of waste products in blood like bilirubin and some tests are used to measure the amount of enzymes that are produced by the liver which may indicate damage of the liver.What is liver and it's functions?The liver is the vital organ present in your body. It is reddish brown in color which may weigh around 3 pounds. The gallbladder is attached at the bottom of the liver along with pancreas and intestines. Liver and these organs help in digestion, absorption, and processing of food. The liver filters the blood which comes from the digestive tract and transports the filtered blood to the remaining parts of the body. The liver also makes proteins which are used for blood clotting and also albumin an important protein in blood serum which transports fatty acids and steroids. It also absorbs and metabolizes bilirubin. Bilirubin is formed as the result of the breakdown of hemoglobin, liver stores the iron released by hemoglobin and utilizes it to make the next generation of red blood cells. It also helps in fat metabolization by breaking down fats and making them digest easily. Liver stores carbohydrates which can be broken down into glucose and later used as energy when needed. It also filters blood from waste products, including alcohol and other drugs. Vitamin A, D, E, K, and B12 are stored by the liver.Importance of liver function test:Liver function tests are mainly used to estimate the severity of a disease like alcoholic hepatitis or viral hepatitis, to detect liver infections like hepatitis or scarring of a liver (cirrhosis), to know the effectiveness of a treatment, to detect the side effects of certain medicines.Liver function tests include the following tests:Albumin- Albumin is a protein made by the liver. Measuring the amount of albumin shows if the liver is producing the required quantity of albumin.Total protein- Measures the amount of proteins made by the liver. Albumin and globulin are the important proteins made by the liver.Total bilirubin- Bilirubin is a yellow pigment in the blood. It passes through the liver and gets excreted. Elevated levels may show liver damage or liver disease.Aspartate transaminase (AST)-  It is an enzyme which metabolizes alanine a type of amino acid. Elevated levels may show liver damage or liver disease.Alanine transaminase (ALT)- It is an enzyme which metabolizes protein. Elevated levels indicate liver damage or liver disease.Alkaline phosphatase (ALP)- It is an enzyme present in liver, bones and bile ducts. High levels of this show liver damage or liver disease.Gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT)- It is an enzyme in the liver used for estimating bile duct problems.","This test may be recommended to you if you experience certain symptoms like dark colored urine, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting, loss of appetite, yellow color skin and eyes, light colored or bloody stools, swollen abdomen, fluid accumulation in abdomen (ascites), pain in abdomen, tiredness, weight loss or weight gain, etc. This test may also be recommended if you have a history of viral hepatitis or a family history of liver disease, drinking too much alcohol or on a medication which may damage your liver function.Pathology test parametersAlbumin Total bilirubinTotal albuminAspartate transaminaseAlanine transaminaseAlkaline phosphataseGamma glutamyl transferaseAlso known as Liver Function Profile Blood, Liver Function Profile, Liver Function Tests.Test PreparationInform your doctor if you are on any medications, have any allergies or underlying medical conditions before your LFT Test.

The liver filters the blood which comes from the digestive tract and transports the filtered blood to the remaining parts of the body. The liver also makes proteins which are used for blood clotting and also albumin an important protein in blood serum which transports fatty acids and steroids. It also absorbs and metabolizes bilirubin. Bilirubin is formed as the result of the breakdown of hemoglobin, liver stores the iron released by hemoglobin and utilizes it to make the next generation of red blood cells. It also helps in fat metabolization by breaking down fats and making them digest easily. Liver stores carbohydrates which can be broken down into glucose and later used as energy when needed. It also filters blood from waste products, including alcohol and other drugs. Vitamin A, D, E, K, and B12 are stored by the liver.Importance of liver function test:Liver function tests are mainly used to estimate the severity of a disease like alcoholic hepatitis or viral hepatitis, to detect liver infections like hepatitis or scarring of a liver (cirrhosis), to know the effectiveness of a treatment, to detect the side effects of certain medicines.Liver function tests include the following tests:Albumin- Albumin is a protein made by the liver. Measuring the amount of albumin shows if the liver is producing the required quantity of albumin.Total protein- Measures the amount of proteins made by the liver. Albumin and globulin are the important proteins made by the liver.Total bilirubin- Bilirubin is a yellow pigment in the blood. It passes through the liver and gets excreted. Elevated levels may show liver damage or liver disease.Aspartate transaminase (AST)-  It is an enzyme which metabolizes alanine a type of amino acid. Elevated levels may show liver damage or liver disease.Alanine transaminase (ALT)- It is an enzyme which metabolizes protein. Elevated levels indicate liver damage or liver disease.Alkaline phosphatase (ALP)- It is an enzyme present in liver, bones and bile ducts. High levels of this show liver damage or liver disease.Gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT)- It is an enzyme in the liver used for estimating bile duct problems.Why this test is performed?This test may be recommended to you if you experience certain symptoms like dark colored urine, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting, loss of appetite, yellow color skin and eyes, light colored or bloody stools, swollen abdomen, fluid accumulation in abdomen (ascites), pain in abdomen, tiredness, weight loss or weight gain, etc. This test may also be recommended if you have a history of viral hepatitis or a family history of liver disease, drinking too much alcohol or on a medication which may damage your liver function.Pathology test parametersAlbumin Total bilirubinTotal albuminAspartate transaminaseAlanine transaminaseAlkaline phosphataseGamma glutamyl transferaseAlso known as Liver Function Profile Blood, Liver Function Profile, Liver Function Tests.","Inform your doctor if you are on any medications, have any allergies or underlying medical conditions before your LFT Test.

CBC Test,Complete Blood Count Automated Blood,₹300,"Complete Blood Count (CBC) is a blood test that measures Red blood cells (RBC), White blood cells (WBC), Platelets (PLTs), Hemoglobin (Hb), and Hematocrit (Hct) in the blood. This test is used to determine the overall health and screen for any diseases that affect the blood cells. What is Blood cells, Hemoglobin, and Hematocrit?Blood is composed of cells and necessary substances such as nutrients and oxygen needed for the health. The blood cells are produced in bone marrow and are released into the blood. It provides nutrients and helps in the transport of gases within cells and tissues.The three main types of blood cells are:Red Blood Cells (RBC):Red blood cells contain a complex protein called hemoglobin. It carries oxygen to the body's organs and tissues from the lungs.White Blood Cells (WBC):White blood cells also called as leukocytes that help to protect the body against infections and foreign invaders, thus an important part of our immune system. These cells are originated from bone marrow but circulate throughout the bloodstream.Platelets (PLTs):Platelets are the smallest blood cells that help the blood to clot during bleeding. Hemoglobin and Hematocrit are other two important substances in the blood. Hemoglobin is a complex protein found in red blood cells. It carries oxygen to the body's organs and tissues from the lungs. It also transports carbon dioxide from the body back to the lungs. Hematocrit is the percentage of red blood cell found in the whole blood. ","This test is performed as part of a routine check-up to monitor the overall health of an individual.  Your doctor may ask you to perform this test to diagnose or to screen for diseases and conditions such as anemia, infections, cancer, or any bleeding disorder. This test is also recommended by your doctor if you experience any signs or symptoms such as weakness, fatigue, shortness of breath, headache, dizziness, pale skin, cold hands, and feet, etc. These are some of the common signs and symptoms which may be associated with anemia or polycythemia.You may be advised to undergo this test if you are pregnant, have a family history of anemia, are suffering from an infection, have had blood loss after surgery, are suffering from heavy and prolonged menstrual bleeding, etc. This test is also performed to monitor the treatment response in individuals receiving treatment for diseases or conditions that affect blood cells.How often this test is performed?If you have a family history of blood disorders or conditions that affect blood cells, your doctor may ask you to perform this test on a 6-monthly basis or a yearly basis. Anemic patients should perform this test on a regular basis, as instructed by the doctor.Pathology test parameters: Red blood cells (RBC), White blood cells (WBC), Platelets (PLTs), Hemoglobin (Hb) and Hematocrit (Hct).Also known as CBC Automated Blood, Complete Blood Picture Automated Blood, CBP Automated Blood, Absolute Blood Count Automated Blood, Complete Blood Count, Platelet Test, WBC Test, Absolute Count, CBC, CBP, Complete Count, Complete Picture, Neutrophils Test, Hb PCV Test.Test PreparationInform your doctor if you are on any medications, have any allergies or underlying medical conditions before your CBC Test. Your doctor will give specific instructions depending on your condition on how to prepare for CBC Test.No specific preparation is required for this test. However, follow all the instructions given by your healthcare provider.Understanding your test resultsGenerally, there is no need for medical interventions if test results are in normal range.If the red blood cells, hemoglobin, and hematocrit levels are lower than the normal range, it may indicate different types of anemia such as iron deficiency anemia, sickle cell anemia, etc. Some medical conditions such as hypothyroidism, splenomegaly (an enlarged spleen), leukemia (a type of blood cancer), chronic kidney disease, internal bleeding due to a stomach ulcer, stomach or colon cancer, etc. may also cause low levels. Deficiency of iron, vitamin B-12,  and folic acid; recent blood donations; heavy prolonged menstrual bleeding, etc. may also result in low levels.If the red blood cells, hemoglobin, and hematocrit levels are higher than the normal range, it may indicate a condition called polycythemia, a type of cancer where the bone marrow produces too many red blood cells.  Medical conditions such as heart or lung diseases, dehydration, etc. may also result in higher levels.If the white blood cell count is lower than the normal range, it may indicate autoimmune disorder like lupus and ulcerative colitis, bone marrow problems, or cancer. If the white blood cell count is higher than the normal range, it may indicate bacterial infections like tuberculosis, viral infections, and fungus. Use of certain medications such as steroids, lithium, and some inhalers may also increase the white blood count.Lower than the normal levels of platelet count is known as thrombocytopenia. This may occur due to medical conditions such as leukemia (a type of blood cancer), aplastic anemia, viral infections, some autoimmune disorders, splenomegaly (an enlarged spleen), cirrhosis of the liver, kidney dysfunction, etc. Other factors such as chemotherapy drugs (cancer medicines); vitamin B12, iron, or folic acid deficiency; chronic alcohol use, etc. may also cause thrombocytopenia.Higher than the normal levels of platelet count is known as thrombocytosis. Thrombocytosis is categorized as primary or essential thrombocytosis and secondary thrombocytosis. Primary thrombocytosis is an uncommon disorder; it generally occurs in individuals greater than 50 years of age, especially in women. It occurs when your bone marrow produces too many platelets. Secondary thrombocytosis may occur due to an ongoing disease condition, certain infections, cancer, anemia, major surgery or trauma, removal of the spleen, etc. Based on the test results, your doctor may advise appropriate medical treatments, lifestyle modifications, or further diagnostic tests.GenderAge groupsValueUNISEXAll age groupsWBC-4000 to 11000 cellsUNISEXAll age groups40-70%UNISEXAll age groups20-40%UNISEXAll age groups2-10%UNISEXAll age groups1-2%UNISEXAll age groups1-8%MALEAll age groups4.32-5.72 million/mcLFEMALEAll age groups3.9-5.03 million/mcLMALEAll age groups40.7-50.3%FEMALEAll age groups36.1 to 44.3%MALEAll age groups13.8-17.2 gm/dlFEMALEAll age groups12.5-15.1g/dlUNISEXAll age groups80-95flYour Cart0 TestsProceed to CheckoutPopular Health Checkup PackagesFeatured CheckupsDiabetes CareWomen's HealthMen's HealthActive Professional Health CheckupIdeal for individuals aged 41 - 60 years78 tests included₹1999₹240017% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowAdvanced Young Indian Health CheckupIdeal for individuals aged 21 - 40 years63 tests included₹1799₹280036% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowComprehensive Active Professional Health CheckupIdeal for individuals aged 41 - 60 years90 tests included₹3499₹490029% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowComprehensive Young Indian Health CheckupIdeal for individuals aged 21 - 40 years84 tests included₹2999₹390023% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowWorking Women's Health CheckupIdeal for individuals aged 21 - 40 years66 tests included₹1799₹330045% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowYoung Indian Health CheckupIdeal for individuals aged 21 - 40 years60 tests included₹749₹115035% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowAdvanced Diabetic Patient's Health CheckupIdeal for individuals aged 35 - 85 years89 tests included₹3599₹500028% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowAdvanced Diabetic Screening CheckupIdeal for individuals aged 35 - 85 years70 tests included₹2199₹300027% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowBasic Diabetic Screening CheckupIdeal for individuals aged 20 - 40 years66 tests included₹1599₹200020% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowDiabetic Patient's Health CheckupIdeal for individuals aged 35 - 85 years77 tests included₹2799₹400030% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowWorking Women's Health CheckupIdeal for individuals aged 21 - 40 years66 tests included₹1799₹330045% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowVitamin Deficiency Health CheckupIdeal for individuals aged 11 - 80 years5 tests included₹1099₹150027% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowWomen's PCOD Detection CheckupIdeal for individuals aged 18 - 45 years37 tests included₹1799₹250028% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowWomen's Skincare CheckupIdeal for individuals aged 15 - 60 years44 tests included₹3499₹550036% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowActive Professional Health CheckupIdeal for individuals aged 41 - 60 years78 tests included₹1999₹240017% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowAdvanced Young Indian Health CheckupIdeal for individuals aged 21 - 40 years63 tests included₹1799₹280036% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowComprehensive Active Professional Health CheckupIdeal for individuals aged 41 - 60 years90 tests included₹3499₹490029% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowComprehensive Young Indian Health CheckupIdeal for individuals aged 21 - 40 years84 tests included₹2999₹390023% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowYoung Indian Health CheckupIdeal for individuals aged 21 - 40 years60 tests included₹749₹115035% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowVitamin Deficiency Health CheckupIdeal for individuals aged 11 - 80 years5 tests included₹1099₹150027% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowThousands of Happy Customers“Very professional phlebo.

Secondary thrombocytosis may occur due to an ongoing disease condition, certain infections, cancer, anemia, major surgery or trauma, removal of the spleen, etc. Based on the test results, your doctor may advise appropriate medical treatments, lifestyle modifications, or further diagnostic tests.GenderAge groupsValueUNISEXAll age groupsWBC-4000 to 11000 cellsUNISEXAll age groups40-70%UNISEXAll age groups20-40%UNISEXAll age groups2-10%UNISEXAll age groups1-2%UNISEXAll age groups1-8%MALEAll age groups4.32-5.72 million/mcLFEMALEAll age groups3.9-5.03 million/mcLMALEAll age groups40.7-50.3%FEMALEAll age groups36.1 to 44.3%MALEAll age groups13.8-17.2 gm/dlFEMALEAll age groups12.5-15.1g/dlUNISEXAll age groups80-95fl",https://www.practo.com/tests/complete-blood-count-automated-blood/p?city=ahmedabad
