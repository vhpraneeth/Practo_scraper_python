The BUN levels may be normal even when if one kidney is damaged and the other is functional.High levels of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) indicate that your kidneys are not working properly. Symptoms of kidney damage are fatigue, bloody, coffee-colored or foamy urine, frequent urination, swelling on face, arms, stomach, legs, feet or around eyes, nausea or vomiting, weakness, muscle cramps etc. Other causes of high BUN levels are conditions that result in poor blood flow to the kidneys such as heart failure, gastrointestinal bleeding, shock, severe burns, or stress and urinary tract obstruction. Use of certain medications like antibiotics, dehydration and a high protein diet may also result in high BUN levels in the blood. Low levels of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) are not very common. This can be due to liver disease or damage, malnutrition, overhydration or lack of protein in the diet. But these conditions are not diagnosed by this test. Women who are on the second or third trimester of pregnancy may also show low BUN levels.If you have higher or lower than normal levels of BUN test results consult your doctor for further instructions.

What is Sodium:Sodium is naturally presented in the food items like canned meat, poultry, fish, ham, sausage, salted nuts, beans etc. It is important for the body to regulate blood volume, to control blood pressure and to maintain osmotic equilibrium and pH levels in the body. Sodium is an important electrolyte and helps in the neuron function. The renin-angiotensin system regulates the amount of fluid and sodium concentration in the body. If there is a decrease in blood volume and sodium concentration, sensors in the heart, blood vessels, and kidney detect it and kidney releases the renin. Renin produces the aldosterone and angiotensin. These hormones help in the retention of sodium in the urine and balance the body fluid, sodium concentration in the body and blood volume. In a similar way, if there is an increase in the sodium concentration and blood volume, the sensors trigger the kidney to excrete the sodium and retain the potassium. When sodium is excreted, blood volume becomes normal.General conditions with abnormal Sodium levels in the body:Hypernatremia is a condition in which there is a high level of sodium in the blood than the normal range. Mostly, this condition is seen in people who don’t drink enough water. Symptoms like dehydration, restlessness, fatigue, thirst, insufficient urine production, irritability, fast heart rate, dry mouth, altered level of consciousness, lack of energy, muscle spasms etc can be seen in people who are suffering from hypernatremia. Hyponatremia is a condition where a low level of sodium is seen in the blood of the body. This includes the following symptoms like a headache, nausea, confusion, fatigue, dizziness, malaise, thirst, mental confusion etc.","The Sodium Blood Test is done to know whether an individual is having normal or abnormal sodium levels in the blood of the body. The doctor may ask to perform this test if an individual is suffering from conditions like hypernatremia (high levels of sodium in the blood), hyponatremia (low levels of sodium in the blood), mental confusion, edema (abnormal accumulation of fluid in the tissues of the body), insufficient urine production. This test is also done to determine the risk of developing a kidney dysfunction, shortness of breath. If an individual is on the treatment of anti-diuretic medications like hydrochlorothiazide, chlorthalidone etc., then the doctor may ask to perform this test to evaluate and to check the effectiveness of the treatment and sodium levels in the body. This helps the doctor to rule out the patient disease condition. If an individual is suffering from symptoms like muscle spasms (overuse of the muscle), lethargy (lack of enthusiasm), thirst (feeling or wanting to drink something), lack of energy, dry mouth (insufficient saliva in the mouth), then the doctor may ask to do the Sodium Blood Test.Generally, when a patient is diagnosed with kidney failure, cirrhosis (severe liver damage causes a scar on the liver and liver failure) or malnutrition (lack of sufficient nutrients in the body) visits hospital for a general check-up, the doctor may ask to undergo the Sodium Blood Test which gives a better status of the condition. This test is also performed to provide a clear idea regarding the malnutrition of an individual and kidney dysfunction. Mostly, this test is done along with other mineral and electrolyte tests to confirm the diagnosis.Precautions:Drugs like antibiotics, lithium, furosemide, torsemide, hydrochlorothiazide etc may change the levels of Sodium in the blood. So inform your doctor prior to the test if you are on these medications.Also known as Sodium (Na) Blood, Sodium, Sodium (Na).Test PreparationInform your doctor if you are on any medications, have any allergies or underlying medical conditions before your Sodium Test. Your doctor will give specific instructions depending on your condition on how to prepare for Sodium Test.There are no specific preparations required for the Sodium Blood Test.Understanding your test resultsIf test results are more than the normal range then it may indicate that there may be conditions likes kidney dysfunction or kidney failure, adrenal glands disorder, diarrhea (frequent discharge of stools in liquid form), diabetes insipidus (the disorder of salt and water metabolism), dehydration, Cushing syndrome (overproduction of cortisol by adrenal glands), increased salt intake in the diet.If test results are less than the normal range, then it indicates that there may be a chance for conditions kidney disease, cirrhosis (severe liver damage causes a scar on the liver and liver failure), Addison disease (The disorder in which adrenal gland doesn’t produce enough hormones), malnutrition (lack of sufficient nutrients in the body), edema (abnormal accumulation of fluid in the tissues of the body) caused by heart failure, vomiting, excessive sweating.GenderAge groupsValueOTHERAll age groups135 - 145mEq/LYour Cart0 TestsProceed to CheckoutPackages containing Sodium TestBasic Diabetic Screening CheckupIdeal for individuals aged 20 - 40 years66 tests included₹1599₹200020% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowActive Professional Health CheckupIdeal for individuals aged 41 - 60 years100 tests included₹1999₹240017% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowAdvanced Diabetic Screening CheckupIdeal for individuals aged 35 - 85 years70 tests included₹2199₹300027% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowAlcohol & Nicotine Health CheckupIdeal for individuals aged 18 - 60 years21 tests included₹1999₹350043% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowComprehensive Young Indian Health CheckupIdeal for individuals aged 21 - 40 years106 tests included₹2999₹390023% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowDiabetic Patient's Health CheckupIdeal for individuals aged 35 - 85 years77 tests included₹2799₹400030% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowComprehensive Active Professional Health CheckupIdeal for individuals aged 41 - 60 years114 tests included₹3499₹490029% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowSenior Citizen Health Checkup - FemaleIdeal for individuals aged 60 - 100 years134 tests included₹3999₹500020% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowSenior Citizen Health Checkup - MaleIdeal for individuals aged 60 - 100 years126 tests included₹3999₹500020% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowAdvanced Diabetic Patient's Health CheckupIdeal for individuals aged 35 - 85 years89 tests included₹3599₹500028% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowThousands of Happy Customers“Very professional phlebo.

Potassium Test,Potassium Blood,,"This test is used to find out the potassium levels in the blood. Potassium is one of the important minerals needed for the body. What is Potassium?Potassium is the positive ion and carries a tiny electrical charge. Potassium is naturally available in many food items like banana, orange, dates, grapefruit, honeydew, potatoes, peas, mushrooms, cucumbers, cooked spinach etc. The average human body contains about 120 grams of potassium. Potassium ions are present in the several proteins and enzymes. Most of the potassium in the body is found inside of the body cells and only a small amount of it is found in the red blood cells.Importance of Potassium:Potassium is well absorbed from the small intestine and eliminated in urine and sweat. It is a soluble mineral and most of it is lost in cooking and processing food. It is very important for the body as it regulates the water balance along with the sodium. With sodium, potassium forms a sodium-potassium pump and this plays an important role in generating the electrical potential for nerve cells that help in the conduction of nerve impulses. As potassium leaves the cell it changes the membrane potential and allows the nerve impulses to progress. This sodium-potassium pump also helps in generating the contractions of muscles and it regulates the heart rate. This pump also prevents the cell swelling by pumping out the sodium. If sodium is pumped out from the cell then the cell swells and bursts. Body is dependent on potassium balance for regular heart contraction and healthy nervous system.Potassium is essential for cellular biochemical reactions and energy metabolism. For the synthesis of proteins from amino acids in the cells, potassium is needed. It also participates in the metabolism of carbohydrates, glucose, and glycogen. Potassium is necessary for building muscle and for normal growth.","The Potassium Blood Test is done to know whether an individual is having normal or abnormal potassium levels in the blood of the body. The doctor may ask to perform this test if an individual is suffering from conditions like hyperkalemia (high levels of potassium) and hypokalemia (low levels of potassium. This test is also done to determine the risk of developing kidney failure. If an individual is on the treatment of anti-diuretic medications like vasopressin, chlorothiazide etc., then the doctor may ask to perform this test to evaluate and to check the effectiveness of the treatment and potassium levels in the body. This helps the doctor to rule out the patient disease condition. If an individual is suffering from symptoms like diarrhea, vomiting, weakness, fatigue, paralysis in the arms and the legs, muscle cramps, irregular heartbeats, constipation, trauma, then the doctor may ask to do the Potassium Blood Test.Generally, when a patient is diagnosed with kidney failure, Diabetes Mellitus (DM) or malnutrition visits hospital for a general check-up, the doctor may ask to undergo the Potassium blood test which gives a better status of the condition.

CBC Test,Complete Blood Count Automated Blood,₹300,"Complete Blood Count (CBC) is a blood test that measures Red blood cells (RBC), White blood cells (WBC), Platelets (PLTs), Hemoglobin (Hb), and Hematocrit (Hct) in the blood. This test is used to determine the overall health and screen for any diseases that affect the blood cells. What is Blood cells, Hemoglobin, and Hematocrit?Blood is composed of cells and necessary substances such as nutrients and oxygen needed for the health. The blood cells are produced in bone marrow and are released into the blood. It provides nutrients and helps in the transport of gases within cells and tissues.The three main types of blood cells are:Red Blood Cells (RBC):Red blood cells contain a complex protein called hemoglobin. It carries oxygen to the body's organs and tissues from the lungs.White Blood Cells (WBC):White blood cells also called as leukocytes that help to protect the body against infections and foreign invaders, thus an important part of our immune system. These cells are originated from bone marrow but circulate throughout the bloodstream.Platelets (PLTs):Platelets are the smallest blood cells that help the blood to clot during bleeding. Hemoglobin and Hematocrit are other two important substances in the blood. Hemoglobin is a complex protein found in red blood cells. It carries oxygen to the body's organs and tissues from the lungs. It also transports carbon dioxide from the body back to the lungs. Hematocrit is the percentage of red blood cell found in the whole blood. ","This test is performed as part of a routine check-up to monitor the overall health of an individual.  Your doctor may ask you to perform this test to diagnose or to screen for diseases and conditions such as anemia, infections, cancer, or any bleeding disorder. This test is also recommended by your doctor if you experience any signs or symptoms such as weakness, fatigue, shortness of breath, headache, dizziness, pale skin, cold hands, and feet, etc. These are some of the common signs and symptoms which may be associated with anemia or polycythemia.You may be advised to undergo this test if you are pregnant, have a family history of anemia, are suffering from an infection, have had blood loss after surgery, are suffering from heavy and prolonged menstrual bleeding, etc. This test is also performed to monitor the treatment response in individuals receiving treatment for diseases or conditions that affect blood cells.How often this test is performed?If you have a family history of blood disorders or conditions that affect blood cells, your doctor may ask you to perform this test on a 6-monthly basis or a yearly basis. Anemic patients should perform this test on a regular basis, as instructed by the doctor.Pathology test parameters: Red blood cells (RBC), White blood cells (WBC), Platelets (PLTs), Hemoglobin (Hb) and Hematocrit (Hct).Also known as CBC Automated Blood, Complete Blood Picture Automated Blood, CBP Automated Blood, Absolute Blood Count Automated Blood, Complete Blood Count, Platelet Test, WBC Test, Absolute Count, CBC, CBP, Complete Count, Complete Picture, Neutrophils Test, Hb PCV Test.Test PreparationInform your doctor if you are on any medications, have any allergies or underlying medical conditions before your CBC Test. Your doctor will give specific instructions depending on your condition on how to prepare for CBC Test.No specific preparation is required for this test. However, follow all the instructions given by your healthcare provider.Understanding your test resultsGenerally, there is no need for medical interventions if test results are in normal range.If the red blood cells, hemoglobin, and hematocrit levels are lower than the normal range, it may indicate different types of anemia such as iron deficiency anemia, sickle cell anemia, etc. Some medical conditions such as hypothyroidism, splenomegaly (an enlarged spleen), leukemia (a type of blood cancer), chronic kidney disease, internal bleeding due to a stomach ulcer, stomach or colon cancer, etc. may also cause low levels. Deficiency of iron, vitamin B-12,  and folic acid; recent blood donations; heavy prolonged menstrual bleeding, etc. may also result in low levels.If the red blood cells, hemoglobin, and hematocrit levels are higher than the normal range, it may indicate a condition called polycythemia, a type of cancer where the bone marrow produces too many red blood cells.  Medical conditions such as heart or lung diseases, dehydration, etc. may also result in higher levels.If the white blood cell count is lower than the normal range, it may indicate autoimmune disorder like lupus and ulcerative colitis, bone marrow problems, or cancer. If the white blood cell count is higher than the normal range, it may indicate bacterial infections like tuberculosis, viral infections, and fungus. Use of certain medications such as steroids, lithium, and some inhalers may also increase the white blood count.Lower than the normal levels of platelet count is known as thrombocytopenia. This may occur due to medical conditions such as leukemia (a type of blood cancer), aplastic anemia, viral infections, some autoimmune disorders, splenomegaly (an enlarged spleen), cirrhosis of the liver, kidney dysfunction, etc. Other factors such as chemotherapy drugs (cancer medicines); vitamin B12, iron, or folic acid deficiency; chronic alcohol use, etc. may also cause thrombocytopenia.Higher than the normal levels of platelet count is known as thrombocytosis.

This test is used to determine the overall health and screen for any diseases that affect the blood cells. What is Blood cells, Hemoglobin, and Hematocrit?Blood is composed of cells and necessary substances such as nutrients and oxygen needed for the health. The blood cells are produced in bone marrow and are released into the blood. It provides nutrients and helps in the transport of gases within cells and tissues.The three main types of blood cells are:Red Blood Cells (RBC):Red blood cells contain a complex protein called hemoglobin. It carries oxygen to the body's organs and tissues from the lungs.White Blood Cells (WBC):White blood cells also called as leukocytes that help to protect the body against infections and foreign invaders, thus an important part of our immune system. These cells are originated from bone marrow but circulate throughout the bloodstream.Platelets (PLTs):Platelets are the smallest blood cells that help the blood to clot during bleeding. Hemoglobin and Hematocrit are other two important substances in the blood. Hemoglobin is a complex protein found in red blood cells. It carries oxygen to the body's organs and tissues from the lungs. It also transports carbon dioxide from the body back to the lungs. Hematocrit is the percentage of red blood cell found in the whole blood. Why this test is performed?This test is performed as part of a routine check-up to monitor the overall health of an individual.  Your doctor may ask you to perform this test to diagnose or to screen for diseases and conditions such as anemia, infections, cancer, or any bleeding disorder. This test is also recommended by your doctor if you experience any signs or symptoms such as weakness, fatigue, shortness of breath, headache, dizziness, pale skin, cold hands, and feet, etc. These are some of the common signs and symptoms which may be associated with anemia or polycythemia.You may be advised to undergo this test if you are pregnant, have a family history of anemia, are suffering from an infection, have had blood loss after surgery, are suffering from heavy and prolonged menstrual bleeding, etc. This test is also performed to monitor the treatment response in individuals receiving treatment for diseases or conditions that affect blood cells.How often this test is performed?If you have a family history of blood disorders or conditions that affect blood cells, your doctor may ask you to perform this test on a 6-monthly basis or a yearly basis. Anemic patients should perform this test on a regular basis, as instructed by the doctor.Pathology test parameters: Red blood cells (RBC), White blood cells (WBC), Platelets (PLTs), Hemoglobin (Hb) and Hematocrit (Hct).Also known as CBC Automated Blood, Complete Blood Picture Automated Blood, CBP Automated Blood, Absolute Blood Count Automated Blood, Complete Blood Count, Platelet Test, WBC Test, Absolute Count, CBC, CBP, Complete Count, Complete Picture, Neutrophils Test, Hb PCV Test.Test PreparationInform your doctor if you are on any medications, have any allergies or underlying medical conditions before your CBC Test. Your doctor will give specific instructions depending on your condition on how to prepare for CBC Test.No specific preparation is required for this test. However, follow all the instructions given by your healthcare provider.Understanding your test resultsGenerally, there is no need for medical interventions if test results are in normal range.If the red blood cells, hemoglobin, and hematocrit levels are lower than the normal range, it may indicate different types of anemia such as iron deficiency anemia, sickle cell anemia, etc. Some medical conditions such as hypothyroidism, splenomegaly (an enlarged spleen), leukemia (a type of blood cancer), chronic kidney disease, internal bleeding due to a stomach ulcer, stomach or colon cancer, etc. may also cause low levels. Deficiency of iron, vitamin B-12,  and folic acid; recent blood donations; heavy prolonged menstrual bleeding, etc. may also result in low levels.If the red blood cells, hemoglobin, and hematocrit levels are higher than the normal range, it may indicate a condition called polycythemia, a type of cancer where the bone marrow produces too many red blood cells.  Medical conditions such as heart or lung diseases, dehydration, etc. may also result in higher levels.If the white blood cell count is lower than the normal range, it may indicate autoimmune disorder like lupus and ulcerative colitis, bone marrow problems, or cancer. If the white blood cell count is higher than the normal range, it may indicate bacterial infections like tuberculosis, viral infections, and fungus. Use of certain medications such as steroids, lithium, and some inhalers may also increase the white blood count.Lower than the normal levels of platelet count is known as thrombocytopenia. This may occur due to medical conditions such as leukemia (a type of blood cancer), aplastic anemia, viral infections, some autoimmune disorders, splenomegaly (an enlarged spleen), cirrhosis of the liver, kidney dysfunction, etc. Other factors such as chemotherapy drugs (cancer medicines); vitamin B12, iron, or folic acid deficiency; chronic alcohol use, etc. may also cause thrombocytopenia.Higher than the normal levels of platelet count is known as thrombocytosis. Thrombocytosis is categorized as primary or essential thrombocytosis and secondary thrombocytosis. Primary thrombocytosis is an uncommon disorder; it generally occurs in individuals greater than 50 years of age, especially in women. It occurs when your bone marrow produces too many platelets. Secondary thrombocytosis may occur due to an ongoing disease condition, certain infections, cancer, anemia, major surgery or trauma, removal of the spleen, etc. Based on the test results, your doctor may advise appropriate medical treatments, lifestyle modifications, or further diagnostic tests.GenderAge groupsValueUNISEXAll age groupsWBC-4000 to 11000 cellsUNISEXAll age groups40-70%UNISEXAll age groups20-40%UNISEXAll age groups2-10%UNISEXAll age groups1-2%UNISEXAll age groups1-8%MALEAll age groups4.32-5.72 million/mcLFEMALEAll age groups3.9-5.03 million/mcLMALEAll age groups40.7-50.3%FEMALEAll age groups36.1 to 44.3%MALEAll age groups13.8-17.2 gm/dlFEMALEAll age groups12.5-15.1g/dlUNISEXAll age groups80-95flYour Cart0 TestsProceed to CheckoutPopular Health Checkup PackagesFeatured CheckupsDiabetes CareWomen's HealthMen's HealthActive Professional Health CheckupIdeal for individuals aged 41 - 60 years100 tests included₹1999₹240017% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowAdvanced Young Indian Health CheckupIdeal for individuals aged 21 - 40 years63 tests included₹1799₹280036% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowComprehensive Active Professional Health CheckupIdeal for individuals aged 41 - 60 years114 tests included₹3499₹490029% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowComprehensive Young Indian Health CheckupIdeal for individuals aged 21 - 40 years106 tests included₹2999₹390023% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowWorking Women's Health CheckupIdeal for individuals aged 21 - 40 years66 tests included₹1799₹330045% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowYoung Indian Health CheckupIdeal for individuals aged 21 - 40 years60 tests included₹749₹115035% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowAdvanced Diabetic Patient's Health CheckupIdeal for individuals aged 35 - 85 years89 tests included₹3599₹500028% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowAdvanced Diabetic Screening CheckupIdeal for individuals aged 35 - 85 years70 tests included₹2199₹300027% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowBasic Diabetic Screening CheckupIdeal for individuals aged 20 - 40 years66 tests included₹1599₹200020% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowDiabetic Patient's Health CheckupIdeal for individuals aged 35 - 85 years77 tests included₹2799₹400030% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowWorking Women's Health CheckupIdeal for individuals aged 21 - 40 years66 tests included₹1799₹330045% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowVitamin Deficiency Health CheckupIdeal for individuals aged 11 - 80 years5 tests included₹1099₹150027% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowWomen's PCOD Detection CheckupIdeal for individuals aged 18 - 45 years37 tests included₹1799₹250028% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowWomen's Skincare CheckupIdeal for individuals aged 15 - 60 years44 tests included₹3499₹550036% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowWomen's Cancer Marker CheckupIdeal for individuals aged 21 - 80 years6 tests included₹2199₹270019% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowSenior Citizen Health Checkup - FemaleIdeal for individuals aged 60 - 100 years134 tests included₹3999₹500020% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowActive Professional Health CheckupIdeal for individuals aged 41 - 60 years100 tests included₹1999₹240017% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowAdvanced Young Indian Health CheckupIdeal for individuals aged 21 - 40 years63 tests included₹1799₹280036% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowComprehensive Active Professional Health CheckupIdeal for individuals aged 41 - 60 years114 tests included₹3499₹490029% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowComprehensive Young Indian Health CheckupIdeal for individuals aged 21 - 40 years106 tests included₹2999₹390023% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowYoung Indian Health CheckupIdeal for individuals aged 21 - 40 years60 tests included₹749₹115035% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowVitamin Deficiency Health CheckupIdeal for individuals aged 11 - 80 years5 tests included₹1099₹150027% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowMen's Cancer Marker CheckupIdeal for individuals aged 21 - 80 years6 tests included₹2199₹270019% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowSenior Citizen Health Checkup - MaleIdeal for individuals aged 60 - 100 years126 tests included₹3999₹500020% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowThousands of Happy Customers“Very professional phlebo.
