LFT Test,Liver Function Tests Blood,,"Liver function test is a set of blood tests used to monitor the working of the liver or to screen the liver damage or inflammation. This test helps in diagnosing a liver disease or liver condition. This test also measures the amount of certain enzymes and proteins in the blood. Some of these tests are helpful in estimating the performance of the liver functions like producing proteins, clearing of waste products in blood like bilirubin and some tests are used to measure the amount of enzymes that are produced by the liver which may indicate damage of the liver.What is liver and it's functions?The liver is the vital organ present in your body. It is reddish brown in color which may weigh around 3 pounds. The gallbladder is attached at the bottom of the liver along with pancreas and intestines. Liver and these organs help in digestion, absorption, and processing of food. The liver filters the blood which comes from the digestive tract and transports the filtered blood to the remaining parts of the body. The liver also makes proteins which are used for blood clotting and also albumin an important protein in blood serum which transports fatty acids and steroids. It also absorbs and metabolizes bilirubin. Bilirubin is formed as the result of the breakdown of hemoglobin, liver stores the iron released by hemoglobin and utilizes it to make the next generation of red blood cells. It also helps in fat metabolization by breaking down fats and making them digest easily. Liver stores carbohydrates which can be broken down into glucose and later used as energy when needed. It also filters blood from waste products, including alcohol and other drugs. Vitamin A, D, E, K, and B12 are stored by the liver.Importance of liver function test:Liver function tests are mainly used to estimate the severity of a disease like alcoholic hepatitis or viral hepatitis, to detect liver infections like hepatitis or scarring of a liver (cirrhosis), to know the effectiveness of a treatment, to detect the side effects of certain medicines.Liver function tests include the following tests:Albumin- Albumin is a protein made by the liver. Measuring the amount of albumin shows if the liver is producing the required quantity of albumin.Total protein- Measures the amount of proteins made by the liver. Albumin and globulin are the important proteins made by the liver.Total bilirubin- Bilirubin is a yellow pigment in the blood. It passes through the liver and gets excreted. Elevated levels may show liver damage or liver disease.Aspartate transaminase (AST)-  It is an enzyme which metabolizes alanine a type of amino acid. Elevated levels may show liver damage or liver disease.Alanine transaminase (ALT)- It is an enzyme which metabolizes protein. Elevated levels indicate liver damage or liver disease.Alkaline phosphatase (ALP)- It is an enzyme present in liver, bones and bile ducts. High levels of this show liver damage or liver disease.Gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT)- It is an enzyme in the liver used for estimating bile duct problems.","This test may be recommended to you if you experience certain symptoms like dark colored urine, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting, loss of appetite, yellow color skin and eyes, light colored or bloody stools, swollen abdomen, fluid accumulation in abdomen (ascites), pain in abdomen, tiredness, weight loss or weight gain, etc. This test may also be recommended if you have a history of viral hepatitis or a family history of liver disease, drinking too much alcohol or on a medication which may damage your liver function.Pathology test parametersAlbumin Total bilirubinTotal albuminAspartate transaminaseAlanine transaminaseAlkaline phosphataseGamma glutamyl transferaseAlso known as Liver Function Profile Blood, Liver Function Profile, Liver Function Tests.Test PreparationInform your doctor if you are on any medications, have any allergies or underlying medical conditions before your LFT Test.

BUN,Urea Nitrogen Blood,₹200,"This test measures the amount of urea nitrogen in the blood. What is urea?Urea is a waste product formed in the liver as a result of protein breakdown. This urea is then released into the blood by the liver. Normally, it is then removed from the blood by the kidneys. Kidneys filter urea and it gets removed from the body through urination. ","This test is one among many tests used to evaluate your kidney function. Your doctor may ask to perform this test if you experience any signs and symptoms of kidney damage such as fatigue, bloody, coffee-colored or foamy urine, frequent urination, swelling on face, arms, stomach, legs, feet or around eyes, nausea or vomiting, weakness, muscle cramps etc. You may be advised to undergo this test if you have diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure or a family history of kidney problems. Your doctor may also ask to perform this test to check the effectiveness of dialysis treatment in case if you are receiving hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. This test may also be performed with other blood tests to rule out other medical conditions, such as liver damage, urinary tract obstruction, congestive heart failure or gastrointestinal bleeding. But these conditions are not diagnosed by this test.","If you have a family history of kidney problems, your doctor may ask you to perform this test on a 6-monthly basis or a yearly basis.

Antibodies are the protective proteins produced by the immune system and also known as immunoglobulins. Antibodies are produced when any foreign substance or virus or bacteria enters into the body. These foreign substances are known as antigens. Antibodies recognize and attach to the antigens in order to remove them from the body.What is H.Pylori?Helicobacter Pylori H. Pylori is a spiral-shaped bacteria and attack the lining of the stomach. Due to its spiral shape, it penetrates into the stomach and gets protected by the mucus. Hence, immune cells are not able to reach them. This bacteria cause serious stomach problems like peptic ulcer, gastritis and most of the stomach ulcers.What are antibodies and their importance?Antibodies are in Y shaped and have two large heavy chains and two small light chains. It has Fc region at the bottom of Y. This Fc region is the part of the antibody which attaches to the antigen. Depending on the Fc region, the antibodies are of five (5) subtypes. They are IgG, IgM, IgA, IgD, IgE.IgG provides long-term protection as it presents in the circulation for long period after the presence of an antigen. IgM is involved in the ABO blood group antigens on the red blood cells (RBC’s) surface. IgM also enhances the ingestion of cells by phagocytosis. IgA is also the first defense for intestine, lungs, and nose. They bind antigens to the microbes before they invade tissues and keeps antigens in secretion and when secretion is expelled, antigens are also expelled. IgD helps in the induction of antibody production and presents on the surface of B-cells. IgE binds to the basophils and mast cells. Why this test is performed?This test is performed to check the presence of H.Pylori Antibodies IgG in blood. The doctor may ask you to undergo this test if you are suffering from conditions such as peptic ulcer, gastritis etc. If symptoms like burning sensation in abdominal pain during the night or after few hours of having food, intestinal bleeding, tenderness, excessive burping, lack of appetite, unexplained weight loss, blood in stools, trouble in swallowing, anemia etc. are seen in an individual, then the doctor may recommend doing this test. If an individual is on the treatment of medications like clarithromycin, omeprazole, amoxicillin, then the doctor may ask to perform this test to evaluate and to check the effectiveness of the treatment and H.Pylori antibodies IgG levels in the blood. Mostly, this test is done along with other antibody tests to confirm the diagnosis.","Some medications may change the levels of IgG in the blood and hence you are advised to inform all your current medications to the doctor prior to the test.Also known as H Pylori Antibodies IgG ELISA Blood, H Pylori Antibodies IgG.","Inform your doctor if you are on any medications, have any allergies or underlying medical conditions before your Helicobacter Pylori Antibodies IgG.

Sodium Test,Sodium Blood,₹200,"This test is used to find out the sodium levels in the blood. Sodium is one of the essential minerals needed for the body. What is Sodium:Sodium is naturally presented in the food items like canned meat, poultry, fish, ham, sausage, salted nuts, beans etc. It is important for the body to regulate blood volume, to control blood pressure and to maintain osmotic equilibrium and pH levels in the body. Sodium is an important electrolyte and helps in the neuron function. The renin-angiotensin system regulates the amount of fluid and sodium concentration in the body. If there is a decrease in blood volume and sodium concentration, sensors in the heart, blood vessels, and kidney detect it and kidney releases the renin. Renin produces the aldosterone and angiotensin. These hormones help in the retention of sodium in the urine and balance the body fluid, sodium concentration in the body and blood volume. In a similar way, if there is an increase in the sodium concentration and blood volume, the sensors trigger the kidney to excrete the sodium and retain the potassium. When sodium is excreted, blood volume becomes normal.General conditions with abnormal Sodium levels in the body:Hypernatremia is a condition in which there is a high level of sodium in the blood than the normal range. Mostly, this condition is seen in people who don’t drink enough water. Symptoms like dehydration, restlessness, fatigue, thirst, insufficient urine production, irritability, fast heart rate, dry mouth, altered level of consciousness, lack of energy, muscle spasms etc can be seen in people who are suffering from hypernatremia. Hyponatremia is a condition where a low level of sodium is seen in the blood of the body. This includes the following symptoms like a headache, nausea, confusion, fatigue, dizziness, malaise, thirst, mental confusion etc.","The Sodium Blood Test is done to know whether an individual is having normal or abnormal sodium levels in the blood of the body. The doctor may ask to perform this test if an individual is suffering from conditions like hypernatremia (high levels of sodium in the blood), hyponatremia (low levels of sodium in the blood), mental confusion, edema (abnormal accumulation of fluid in the tissues of the body), insufficient urine production. This test is also done to determine the risk of developing a kidney dysfunction, shortness of breath. If an individual is on the treatment of anti-diuretic medications like hydrochlorothiazide, chlorthalidone etc., then the doctor may ask to perform this test to evaluate and to check the effectiveness of the treatment and sodium levels in the body. This helps the doctor to rule out the patient disease condition. If an individual is suffering from symptoms like muscle spasms (overuse of the muscle), lethargy (lack of enthusiasm), thirst (feeling or wanting to drink something), lack of energy, dry mouth (insufficient saliva in the mouth), then the doctor may ask to do the Sodium Blood Test.Generally, when a patient is diagnosed with kidney failure, cirrhosis (severe liver damage causes a scar on the liver and liver failure) or malnutrition (lack of sufficient nutrients in the body) visits hospital for a general check-up, the doctor may ask to undergo the Sodium Blood Test which gives a better status of the condition. This test is also performed to provide a clear idea regarding the malnutrition of an individual and kidney dysfunction. Mostly, this test is done along with other mineral and electrolyte tests to confirm the diagnosis.Precautions:Drugs like antibiotics, lithium, furosemide, torsemide, hydrochlorothiazide etc may change the levels of Sodium in the blood. So inform your doctor prior to the test if you are on these medications.Also known as Sodium (Na) Blood, Sodium, Sodium (Na).Test PreparationInform your doctor if you are on any medications, have any allergies or underlying medical conditions before your Sodium Test.

Chloride,Chloride Blood,₹200,The chloride blood test is used to estimate levels of chloride in the blood. This test is usually a part of the basic metabolic panel or a routine blood test. It is used to diagnose a condition relating to an imbalance of acids and bases in the body called as acidosis and alkalosis. Acidosis is a condition in which high levels of acid is seen in blood. Alkalosis is a condition in which blood is too alkaline or basic.  What is Chloride?Chloride is an important mineral and a type of electrolyte which works with other electrolytes like potassium and sodium. Chloride is an electrically charged mineral and helps balance acids and bases in the body. It also moves fluid in and out of the cells. Hence low levels of chloride may lead to dehydration and high levels indicate improper functioning of kidneys. ,"This test may be recommended to you if you experience certain symptoms like tiredness, weakness, vomiting, diarrhea or dehydration. This test may also be recommended to check certain conditions like hyperchloremia or hypochloremia, hyperventilation, metabolic acidosis,  respiratory acidosis, etc. Sometimes diabetes can also elevate the levels of chloride. Other electrolyte tests may be ordered to see the acid-base imbalance.Precautions:Some medications may interfere with your test results such as diuretics (thiazide, furosemide, torsemide, etc), NSAIDs  (acetaminophen, naproxen, ibuprofen, etc) and certain hormones. Intake of large quantities of baking soda and overdose of antacids may cause low levels of chloride in blood. Hence inform your doctor or technician about all your current medications and medical conditions prior to the test.Also known as Chloride (Cl-) Blood, Chloride Test, Chloride (Cl-).Test PreparationInform your doctor if you are on any medications, have any allergies or underlying medical conditions before your Chloride. Your doctor will give specific instructions depending on your condition on how to prepare for Chloride.No specific preparation is required for a chloride blood test.Understanding your test resultsThe test results may vary depending on gender, age, health history, etc.If your test results are higher than the normal range then it may indicate a condition called hyperchloremia (high levels of chloride in the blood). Hyperchloremia condition is a result of dehydration but may also occur with high levels of sodium in some conditions like kidney disease or Cushing's syndrome. Hyperchloremia condition is seen when high amounts of the base are lost from the body leading to metabolic acidosis or it is also due to hyperventilation.If your test results are lower than the normal range then it may indicate a condition called hypochloremia (low level of blood chloride). This condition may occur due to any disorders relating to low levels of blood sodium. This condition is also seen with congestive heart failure, lung diseases causing respiratory acidosis, many episodes of vomiting or prolonged gastric suction, due to losing acid from the body (metabolic alkalosis), Addison’s disease (where adrenal glands do not release enough hormones).If you get abnormal test results does not always mean you have a medical condition. Consult your doctor with your test results. Your doctor may recommend other tests depending on your results.GenderAge groupsValueOTHERAll age groups96 - 106mEq/LYour Cart0 TestsProceed to CheckoutPackages containing ChlorideBasic Diabetic Screening CheckupIdeal for individuals aged 20 - 40 years66 tests included₹1599₹200020% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowActive Professional Health CheckupIdeal for individuals aged 41 - 60 years100 tests included₹1999₹240017% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowAdvanced Diabetic Screening CheckupIdeal for individuals aged 35 - 85 years70 tests included₹2199₹300027% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowAlcohol & Nicotine Health CheckupIdeal for individuals aged 18 - 60 years21 tests included₹1999₹350043% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowComprehensive Young Indian Health CheckupIdeal for individuals aged 21 - 40 years106 tests included₹2999₹390023% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowDiabetic Patient's Health CheckupIdeal for individuals aged 35 - 85 years77 tests included₹2799₹400030% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowComprehensive Active Professional Health CheckupIdeal for individuals aged 41 - 60 years114 tests included₹3499₹490029% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowSenior Citizen Health Checkup - FemaleIdeal for individuals aged 60 - 100 years134 tests included₹3999₹500020% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowSenior Citizen Health Checkup - MaleIdeal for individuals aged 60 - 100 years126 tests included₹3999₹500020% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowAdvanced Diabetic Patient's Health CheckupIdeal for individuals aged 35 - 85 years89 tests included₹3599₹500028% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowThousands of Happy Customers“Very professional phlebo.

This test is usually a part of the basic metabolic panel or a routine blood test. It is used to diagnose a condition relating to an imbalance of acids and bases in the body called as acidosis and alkalosis. Acidosis is a condition in which high levels of acid is seen in blood. Alkalosis is a condition in which blood is too alkaline or basic.  What is Chloride?Chloride is an important mineral and a type of electrolyte which works with other electrolytes like potassium and sodium. Chloride is an electrically charged mineral and helps balance acids and bases in the body. It also moves fluid in and out of the cells. Hence low levels of chloride may lead to dehydration and high levels indicate improper functioning of kidneys. Why this test is performed?This test may be recommended to you if you experience certain symptoms like tiredness, weakness, vomiting, diarrhea or dehydration. This test may also be recommended to check certain conditions like hyperchloremia or hypochloremia, hyperventilation, metabolic acidosis,  respiratory acidosis, etc. Sometimes diabetes can also elevate the levels of chloride. Other electrolyte tests may be ordered to see the acid-base imbalance.","Some medications may interfere with your test results such as diuretics (thiazide, furosemide, torsemide, etc), NSAIDs  (acetaminophen, naproxen, ibuprofen, etc) and certain hormones. Intake of large quantities of baking soda and overdose of antacids may cause low levels of chloride in blood. Hence inform your doctor or technician about all your current medications and medical conditions prior to the test.Also known as Chloride (Cl-) Blood, Chloride Test, Chloride (Cl-).","Inform your doctor if you are on any medications, have any allergies or underlying medical conditions before your Chloride. Your doctor will give specific instructions depending on your condition on how to prepare for Chloride.No specific preparation is required for a chloride blood test.","The test results may vary depending on gender, age, health history, etc.If your test results are higher than the normal range then it may indicate a condition called hyperchloremia (high levels of chloride in the blood). Hyperchloremia condition is a result of dehydration but may also occur with high levels of sodium in some conditions like kidney disease or Cushing's syndrome. Hyperchloremia condition is seen when high amounts of the base are lost from the body leading to metabolic acidosis or it is also due to hyperventilation.If your test results are lower than the normal range then it may indicate a condition called hypochloremia (low level of blood chloride). This condition may occur due to any disorders relating to low levels of blood sodium. This condition is also seen with congestive heart failure, lung diseases causing respiratory acidosis, many episodes of vomiting or prolonged gastric suction, due to losing acid from the body (metabolic alkalosis), Addison’s disease (where adrenal glands do not release enough hormones).If you get abnormal test results does not always mean you have a medical condition. Consult your doctor with your test results. Your doctor may recommend other tests depending on your results.GenderAge groupsValueOTHERAll age groups96 - 106mEq/L",https://www.practo.com/tests/chloride-blood/p?city=hyderabad
Vitamin Profile,Vitamin Profile Blood,,"What is Vitamin Profile? Vitamins and minerals are essential nutrients for human life. Unhealthy eating habits and adulteration of food can lead to depletion of these vital nutrients and limit the ability of our body to fight against infections. This profile is specially designed to test as: 1. 25-OH VITAMIN D (TOTAL), 2. CALCIUM, 3. FOLATE, 4. THYROID STIMULATING HORMONE (TSH), 5. VITAMIN B-12. Why is Vitamin Profile done?If you have symptoms of vitamin D deficiency like bone malformation in children (rickets), bone weakness, or fractures in adults (osteomalacia)If you have risk factors for vitamin D deficiency like old age, limited sun exposure, obesity, or you have undergone gastric bypass surgery If you have symptoms of anemia like weakness, tiredness, pale skin (deficiency of B12), or folic acid deficiencyIf you have symptoms or signs of nerve problems like numbness, burning in hands, feet, arms, tingling sensation which may be due to vitamin B12 deficiencyWhat does Vitamin Profile Measure? For healthy living, vitamins play a very important role. However, any deficiency or increased presence of these vitamins are not good for health. The deficiency of vitamins can be due to not taking proper diet while excess can be due to excessive supplementation. Vitamins are classified as Water soluble and Fat-soluble vitamins.Fat-soluble vitamins include: Vitamin A, K, D, and EWater-soluble vitamins include Vitamin B-1 (Thiamine), B-2 (Riboflavin), B-3 (Niacin), B-5 (Pantothenic acid), B-6 (Pyridoxine), B-7 (Biotin), B-9 (Folate), B-12 (Cobalamin), and  Vitamin C. The most common vitamins which are found deficient include Vitamin D, Vitamin B12, and Vitamin B9. Vitamin D helps our body absorb calcium and phosphorus, and maintain strong bones and teeth. Vitamin D (25-OH) test measures the level of Vitamin D (25-OH) in the blood which is a useful indicator of osteoporosis (bone weakness), rickets (bone malformation), and osteomalacia.Vitamin B12 is also called Cobalamin. It is a water-soluble vitamin. Vitamin B12 plays an important role in the formation of normal red blood cells, repair of tissues, DNA synthesis, and genetic material in cells. It is not produced in the body and has to be taken in the diet. The diet sources which includes Vitamin B12 are red meat, fish, milk, poultry, yogurt, eggs, fortified cereals, bread, and other grain products. It can also be taken in the form of Vitamin B12 tablets or multivitamin pills. Low levels of Vitamin B12 results in macrocytic anemia (size of red blood cells larger than normal).Vitamin B9 along with Vitamin B12 and iron plays an important role in the formation of red blood cells. It plays an important role in the functioning of nerves and cell replication in the body. In pregnant ladies, it is required for proper development of fetus spinal cord. Low levels of Vitamin B9 can lead to anemia.Test PreparationInform your doctor if you are on any medications, have any allergies or underlying medical conditions before your Vitamin Profile.

Vitamins and minerals are essential nutrients for human life. Unhealthy eating habits and adulteration of food can lead to depletion of these vital nutrients and limit the ability of our body to fight against infections. This profile is specially designed to test as: 1. 25-OH VITAMIN D (TOTAL), 2. CALCIUM, 3. FOLATE, 4. THYROID STIMULATING HORMONE (TSH), 5. VITAMIN B-12. Why is Vitamin Profile done?If you have symptoms of vitamin D deficiency like bone malformation in children (rickets), bone weakness, or fractures in adults (osteomalacia)If you have risk factors for vitamin D deficiency like old age, limited sun exposure, obesity, or you have undergone gastric bypass surgery If you have symptoms of anemia like weakness, tiredness, pale skin (deficiency of B12), or folic acid deficiencyIf you have symptoms or signs of nerve problems like numbness, burning in hands, feet, arms, tingling sensation which may be due to vitamin B12 deficiencyWhat does Vitamin Profile Measure? For healthy living, vitamins play a very important role. However, any deficiency or increased presence of these vitamins are not good for health. The deficiency of vitamins can be due to not taking proper diet while excess can be due to excessive supplementation. Vitamins are classified as Water soluble and Fat-soluble vitamins.Fat-soluble vitamins include: Vitamin A, K, D, and EWater-soluble vitamins include Vitamin B-1 (Thiamine), B-2 (Riboflavin), B-3 (Niacin), B-5 (Pantothenic acid), B-6 (Pyridoxine), B-7 (Biotin), B-9 (Folate), B-12 (Cobalamin), and  Vitamin C. The most common vitamins which are found deficient include Vitamin D, Vitamin B12, and Vitamin B9. Vitamin D helps our body absorb calcium and phosphorus, and maintain strong bones and teeth. Vitamin D (25-OH) test measures the level of Vitamin D (25-OH) in the blood which is a useful indicator of osteoporosis (bone weakness), rickets (bone malformation), and osteomalacia.Vitamin B12 is also called Cobalamin. It is a water-soluble vitamin. Vitamin B12 plays an important role in the formation of normal red blood cells, repair of tissues, DNA synthesis, and genetic material in cells. It is not produced in the body and has to be taken in the diet. The diet sources which includes Vitamin B12 are red meat, fish, milk, poultry, yogurt, eggs, fortified cereals, bread, and other grain products. It can also be taken in the form of Vitamin B12 tablets or multivitamin pills. Low levels of Vitamin B12 results in macrocytic anemia (size of red blood cells larger than normal).Vitamin B9 along with Vitamin B12 and iron plays an important role in the formation of red blood cells. It plays an important role in the functioning of nerves and cell replication in the body. In pregnant ladies, it is required for proper development of fetus spinal cord. Low levels of Vitamin B9 can lead to anemia.","Inform your doctor if you are on any medications, have any allergies or underlying medical conditions before your Vitamin Profile.
