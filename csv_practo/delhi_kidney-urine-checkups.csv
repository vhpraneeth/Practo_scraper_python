Creatinine Test,Creatinine Conventional Blood,₹200,Serum creatinine test is used to measure the levels of creatinine in your blood.  ,Creatinine is a waste product from the breakdown of creatine found in your muscle. This test is performed to see how well your kidneys are working.,"Each kidney is made up of tiny blood-filtering structural units called nephrons. The nephrons filter blood constantly through a very small cluster of blood vessels called glomeruli. These filter waste products, excess water, and impurities of blood. These toxins are stored in the bladder and removed through urination. Creatinine is eliminated through kidney from our body. Hence measuring the level of creatinine in the blood indicate your kidney function. High levels of creatinine in blood show kidney impairment. ", ,"Inform your doctor if you are on any medications, have any allergies or underlying medical conditions before your Creatinine Test. Your doctor will give specific instructions depending on your condition on how to prepare for Creatinine Test.","If the serum creatinine levels are more than the normal level then it may indicate kidney disease, obstruction in your urinary system, congestive heart failure, dehydration, diabetes, shock, overactive thyroid gland, problems during pregnancy like such as seizures due to eclampsia or high blood pressure caused by preeclampsia etc.",https://www.practo.com/tests/creatinine-conventional-blood/p?city=delhi
BUN,Urea Nitrogen Blood,₹200,This test measures the amount of urea nitrogen in the blood.  ,"Urea is a waste product formed in the liver as a result of protein breakdown. This urea is then released into the blood by the liver. Normally, it is then removed from the blood by the kidneys. Kidneys filter urea and it gets removed from the body through urination. ",,"This test is one among many tests used to evaluate your kidney function. Your doctor may ask to perform this test if you experience any signs and symptoms of kidney damage such as fatigue, bloody, coffee-colored or foamy urine, frequent urination, swelling on face, arms, stomach, legs, feet or around eyes, nausea or vomiting, weakness, muscle cramps etc. You may be advised to undergo this test if you have diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure or a family history of kidney problems. Your doctor may also ask to perform this test to check the effectiveness of dialysis treatment in case if you are receiving hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. This test may also be performed with other blood tests to rule out other medical conditions, such as liver damage, urinary tract obstruction, congestive heart failure or gastrointestinal bleeding. But these conditions are not diagnosed by this test. ","Inform your doctor if you are on any medications, have any allergies or underlying medical conditions before your BUN. Your doctor will give specific instructions depending on your condition on how to prepare for BUN.",If the test result falls in the normal reference range generally no medical intervention is necessary. The BUN levels may be normal even when if one kidney is damaged and the other is functional.,https://www.practo.com/tests/urea-nitrogen-blood/p?city=delhi
