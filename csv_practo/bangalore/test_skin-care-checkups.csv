Vitamin Profile,Vitamin Profile Blood,₹1200,"What is Vitamin Profile? Vitamins and minerals are essential nutrients for human life. Unhealthy eating habits and adulteration of food can lead to depletion of these vital nutrients and limit the ability of our body to fight against infections. This profile is specially designed to test as: 1. 25-OH VITAMIN D (TOTAL), 2. CALCIUM, 3. FOLATE, 4. THYROID STIMULATING HORMONE (TSH), 5. VITAMIN B-12. Why is Vitamin Profile done?If you have symptoms of vitamin D deficiency like bone malformation in children (rickets), bone weakness, or fractures in adults (osteomalacia)If you have risk factors for vitamin D deficiency like old age, limited sun exposure, obesity, or you have undergone gastric bypass surgery If you have symptoms of anemia like weakness, tiredness, pale skin (deficiency of B12), or folic acid deficiencyIf you have symptoms or signs of nerve problems like numbness, burning in hands, feet, arms, tingling sensation which may be due to vitamin B12 deficiencyWhat does Vitamin Profile Measure? For healthy living, vitamins play a very important role. However, any deficiency or increased presence of these vitamins are not good for health. The deficiency of vitamins can be due to not taking proper diet while excess can be due to excessive supplementation. Vitamins are classified as Water soluble and Fat-soluble vitamins.Fat-soluble vitamins include: Vitamin A, K, D, and EWater-soluble vitamins include Vitamin B-1 (Thiamine), B-2 (Riboflavin), B-3 (Niacin), B-5 (Pantothenic acid), B-6 (Pyridoxine), B-7 (Biotin), B-9 (Folate), B-12 (Cobalamin), and  Vitamin C. The most common vitamins which are found deficient include Vitamin D, Vitamin B12, and Vitamin B9. Vitamin D helps our body absorb calcium and phosphorus, and maintain strong bones and teeth. Vitamin D (25-OH) test measures the level of Vitamin D (25-OH) in the blood which is a useful indicator of osteoporosis (bone weakness), rickets (bone malformation), and osteomalacia.Vitamin B12 is also called Cobalamin. It is a water-soluble vitamin. Vitamin B12 plays an important role in the formation of normal red blood cells, repair of tissues, DNA synthesis, and genetic material in cells. It is not produced in the body and has to be taken in the diet. The diet sources which includes Vitamin B12 are red meat, fish, milk, poultry, yogurt, eggs, fortified cereals, bread, and other grain products. It can also be taken in the form of Vitamin B12 tablets or multivitamin pills. Low levels of Vitamin B12 results in macrocytic anemia (size of red blood cells larger than normal).Vitamin B9 along with Vitamin B12 and iron plays an important role in the formation of red blood cells. It plays an important role in the functioning of nerves and cell replication in the body. In pregnant ladies, it is required for proper development of fetus spinal cord. Low levels of Vitamin B9 can lead to anemia.Test PreparationInform your doctor if you are on any medications, have any allergies or underlying medical conditions before your Vitamin Profile.

Vitamins and minerals are essential nutrients for human life. Unhealthy eating habits and adulteration of food can lead to depletion of these vital nutrients and limit the ability of our body to fight against infections. This profile is specially designed to test as: 1. 25-OH VITAMIN D (TOTAL), 2. CALCIUM, 3. FOLATE, 4. THYROID STIMULATING HORMONE (TSH), 5. VITAMIN B-12. Why is Vitamin Profile done?If you have symptoms of vitamin D deficiency like bone malformation in children (rickets), bone weakness, or fractures in adults (osteomalacia)If you have risk factors for vitamin D deficiency like old age, limited sun exposure, obesity, or you have undergone gastric bypass surgery If you have symptoms of anemia like weakness, tiredness, pale skin (deficiency of B12), or folic acid deficiencyIf you have symptoms or signs of nerve problems like numbness, burning in hands, feet, arms, tingling sensation which may be due to vitamin B12 deficiencyWhat does Vitamin Profile Measure? For healthy living, vitamins play a very important role. However, any deficiency or increased presence of these vitamins are not good for health. The deficiency of vitamins can be due to not taking proper diet while excess can be due to excessive supplementation. Vitamins are classified as Water soluble and Fat-soluble vitamins.Fat-soluble vitamins include: Vitamin A, K, D, and EWater-soluble vitamins include Vitamin B-1 (Thiamine), B-2 (Riboflavin), B-3 (Niacin), B-5 (Pantothenic acid), B-6 (Pyridoxine), B-7 (Biotin), B-9 (Folate), B-12 (Cobalamin), and  Vitamin C. The most common vitamins which are found deficient include Vitamin D, Vitamin B12, and Vitamin B9. Vitamin D helps our body absorb calcium and phosphorus, and maintain strong bones and teeth. Vitamin D (25-OH) test measures the level of Vitamin D (25-OH) in the blood which is a useful indicator of osteoporosis (bone weakness), rickets (bone malformation), and osteomalacia.Vitamin B12 is also called Cobalamin. It is a water-soluble vitamin. Vitamin B12 plays an important role in the formation of normal red blood cells, repair of tissues, DNA synthesis, and genetic material in cells. It is not produced in the body and has to be taken in the diet. The diet sources which includes Vitamin B12 are red meat, fish, milk, poultry, yogurt, eggs, fortified cereals, bread, and other grain products. It can also be taken in the form of Vitamin B12 tablets or multivitamin pills. Low levels of Vitamin B12 results in macrocytic anemia (size of red blood cells larger than normal).Vitamin B9 along with Vitamin B12 and iron plays an important role in the formation of red blood cells. It plays an important role in the functioning of nerves and cell replication in the body. In pregnant ladies, it is required for proper development of fetus spinal cord. Low levels of Vitamin B9 can lead to anemia.","Inform your doctor if you are on any medications, have any allergies or underlying medical conditions before your Vitamin Profile.

T3 T4 TSH,Thyroid Profile Total Blood,₹400,"Thyroid Function Test panel measures the levels of total thyroxine T-4, total triiodothyronine T-3 and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) in blood. What is Thyroid Stimulating Hormone?The thyroid stimulating hormone is a pituitary hormone that stimulates the thyroid gland to produce triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4) hormones. These hormones help to control the rate at which energy is used in almost every tissue in the body.What are T4 and T3 Hormones?Thyroxine (T4) and Triiodothyronine (T3) which are secreted into the blood binds reversibly to the transport proteins like thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG), thyroxine binding prealbumin (TBPA), and albumin. Remaining unbound T4 and T3 circulates freely in blood and used by the body. This freely circulating Thyroxine (T4) and Triiodothyronine (T3) are known as Free Thyroxine FT-4 and Free triiodothyronine FT-3.What are Hyper and Hypothyroidism?This test is performed to measure whether the thyroid gland is hyperactive (Hyperthyroidism) or underactive (Hypothyroidism). Hyperthyroidism is a condition in which thyroid gland produces excessive hormones. This condition may cause signs and symptoms such as weight loss, irritability, sweating, and irregular heartbeats. Hypothyroidism is a condition in which thyroid gland does not produce enough hormones. This condition may cause weight gain, dry skin, constipation, feeling cold and slow heart rate. Your doctor may ask you to undergo this test if you exhibit any of these signs or symptoms.Why This Test is Done?The doctor may ask to get this test done if the patient is suffering from symptoms like unexplained weight loss or weight gain, fatigue, weakness, difficulty in concentrating which are common symptoms of thyroid disorders. In some cases, this test is performed to find out the effectiveness of the treatment. If a patient is on the treatment of artificial thyroid hormones then the doctor prefers this test to evaluate and to check the thyroid hormone levels in the body. This helps the doctor to rule out the patient’s disease condition.Precautions:Drugs like amiodarone, thiourea, lithium, phenylbutazone, sulfonamides and birth control pills may change the levels of Total Thyroxine T4 in the blood. Drugs like carbimazole, methimazole may affect the levels of TSH in blood. Hence, all medications should be reported to the doctor before undergoing this test.During pregnancy, T3, T4 levels may be abnormal and usually, it becomes stabilized after a period of time.Pathology test parameters:The Thyroid Profile Total test has the following components i.e:- Total Thyroxine T4, Total Triiodothyronine T3, and Thyroid Stimulating Hormone TSH.Also known as Thyroid Function Tests Total Blood, TFT Total Blood, TFT Total, Thyroid Function Tests Total.Test PreparationInform your doctor if you are on any medications, have any allergies or underlying medical conditions before your T3 T4 TSH. Your doctor will give specific instructions depending on your condition on how to prepare for T3 T4 TSH.There are no specific preparations required for the Thyroid Profile Total test.Understanding your test resultsIf the test results are in normal range then the thyroid gland is functioning normally and no need for further medical intervention.In the case of increased T3 and T4 levels in the blood than the normal range then it may be due to transient hyperthyroidism, Hashimoto's thyroiditis (an auto-immune disorder where the immune system of own body attacks the thyroid gland and decreases the production of hormones that are required for the body), Grave’s disease (an immune system disorder which results in the overproduction of thyroid hormones), subacute thyroiditis (acute inflammation of the thyroid gland), toxic adenoma (increased hormone production from single large nodule/lump in the thyroid gland), toxic multinodular goiter, thyroid cancer, increased production of thyroid stimulating hormone.If the levels of T4 and T3 are less than the normal range then it may be due to hypothyroidism, previous treatment of hyperthyroidism, subacute thyroiditis (acute inflammation of the thyroid gland), neck radiotherapy before the test, iodine deficiency or excessive iodine, pituitary dysfunction, idiopathic myxedema (severe hypothyroidism), tissue resistance to thyroid hormone, starvation, or long-term illness, etc.If TSH levels alone increased and T4, T3 levels are within the range then it may be due to mild hypothyroidism.In case of reduced levels of TSH, it may indicate hyperthyroidism. If all the three TSH, T4 and T3 levels are low then it may be caused by nonthyroidal illness or pituitary hypothyroidism.GenderAge groupsValueUNISEXAll age groups80 - 200ng/dlUNISEXAll age groups4.5 - 11.7 mcg/dlUNISEXAll age groups0.3 - 5U/mlYour Cart0 TestsProceed to CheckoutPopular Health Checkup PackagesFeatured CheckupsDiabetes CareWomen's HealthMen's HealthComprehensive Active Professional Health CheckupIdeal for individuals aged 41 - 60 years114 tests included₹3499₹490029% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowAdvanced Young Indian Health CheckupIdeal for individuals aged 21 - 40 years63 tests included₹1799₹280036% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowAdvanced Diabetic Screening CheckupIdeal for individuals aged 35 - 85 years70 tests included₹2199₹300027% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowAdvanced Diabetic Patient's Health CheckupIdeal for individuals aged 35 - 85 years89 tests included₹3599₹500028% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowWomen's PCOD Detection CheckupIdeal for individuals aged 18 - 45 years37 tests included₹1799₹250028% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowWomen's Skincare CheckupIdeal for individuals aged 15 - 60 years44 tests included₹3499₹550036% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowComprehensive Active Professional Health CheckupIdeal for individuals aged 41 - 60 years114 tests included₹3499₹490029% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowAdvanced Young Indian Health CheckupIdeal for individuals aged 21 - 40 years63 tests included₹1799₹280036% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowThousands of Happy Customers“Very professional phlebo.

Vitamin D3,Vitamin D Profile Blood,,"Vitamin D profile test is used to measure the levels of vitamin D in your body. What is Vitamin-D?Vitamin D is an essential compound required for proper growth and development of teeth and bones. There are two forms of vitamin D that can be measured in blood. They are 25-hydroxyvitamin D and 1, 25- dihydroxyvitamin D. The two sources of vitamin D is endogenous or exogenous. Endogenous sources are produced in the skin by the exposure to sunlight. The exogenous sources are through food and supplements. Vitamin D2 and vitamin D3 are the two chemical structures of the Vitamin D. Vitamin D2 is called ergocalciferol which is mostly found in fortified foods and most vitamin preparations and supplements. Vitamin D3 is called cholecalciferol and is produced in the body and also used in some supplements. These two vitamin D2 and vitamin D3 are converted to 1, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D.Importance of Vitamin-DThe main role of vitamin D is to regulate the levels of phosphorus, calcium, and magnesium in the body. Vitamin D helps in the growth of bones. Vitamin D deficiency makes the bones soft, malformed, and unable to repair and leading to diseases like rickets in children and osteomalacia in adults. It also helps in regulating the immune system and also in the growth of many other tissues. The main sources of vitamin D are fishes like salmon, mackerel, cod liver oil, fortified milk, bread, eggs, and cereals. ","This vitamin D test may be recommended to you if you have any abnormal calcium or phosphorus level or abnormal parathyroid levels. This test is also recommended if you have evidence of bone weakness or bone disorders or if you are at high risk of vitamin D deficiency. This test is also performed before starting the treatment for osteoporosis and later to check the progress of treatment. This test is recommended to you if you have a malformation of bones, weakness, osteomalacia, fractures, gastric bypass surgery, malabsorption of fat, people with darker skin, breastfeeding mothers, kidney diseases or sarcoidosis, or lymphomas, etc. This test is also recommended to you if you have a chronic illness such as asthma, psoriasis, or certain immune disorders.Pathology test parameters:1, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D (Calcitriol)25-hydroxyvitamin D (Calcidiol)Precautions:Some anti-seizure drugs such as phenytoin may interact with the test results. An overdose of vitamin tablets also interferes with the test results. Hence, inform your doctor or technician about all your current medications and medical conditions prior to the test.Also known as Vit D3 Test, Vit D Profile Blood, Vitamin D Test, D3 Test, Vitamin D3 Test, Vitamin D3 Level Test, Vit D Profile, Vitamin D Profile, Vit D3, Vitamin D Total, Vitamin D Total Test.Test PreparationInform your doctor if you are on any medications, have any allergies or underlying medical conditions before your Vitamin D3.

What is Vitamin-D?Vitamin D is an essential compound required for proper growth and development of teeth and bones. There are two forms of vitamin D that can be measured in blood. They are 25-hydroxyvitamin D and 1, 25- dihydroxyvitamin D. The two sources of vitamin D is endogenous or exogenous. Endogenous sources are produced in the skin by the exposure to sunlight. The exogenous sources are through food and supplements. Vitamin D2 and vitamin D3 are the two chemical structures of the Vitamin D. Vitamin D2 is called ergocalciferol which is mostly found in fortified foods and most vitamin preparations and supplements. Vitamin D3 is called cholecalciferol and is produced in the body and also used in some supplements. These two vitamin D2 and vitamin D3 are converted to 1, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D.Importance of Vitamin-DThe main role of vitamin D is to regulate the levels of phosphorus, calcium, and magnesium in the body. Vitamin D helps in the growth of bones. Vitamin D deficiency makes the bones soft, malformed, and unable to repair and leading to diseases like rickets in children and osteomalacia in adults. It also helps in regulating the immune system and also in the growth of many other tissues. The main sources of vitamin D are fishes like salmon, mackerel, cod liver oil, fortified milk, bread, eggs, and cereals. Why this test is performed?This vitamin D test may be recommended to you if you have any abnormal calcium or phosphorus level or abnormal parathyroid levels. This test is also recommended if you have evidence of bone weakness or bone disorders or if you are at high risk of vitamin D deficiency. This test is also performed before starting the treatment for osteoporosis and later to check the progress of treatment.

Serum B12,Vitamin B12 Conventional Blood,₹400,"This test is used to find out the conventional Vitamin-B12 levels in the blood. What is Vitamin-B12?Vitamin-B12 is an essential vitamin which is naturally present in milk, fish, meat, eggs, poultry etc. It is also known as cobalamin. Vitamin-B12 is required for the body for good health of the blood and nerve cells. It also helps in the synthesis of DNA which is a genetic material in all cells.Vitamin-B12 is absorbed by the body in 2 steps. At first hydrochloric acid in the stomach separates Vitamin-B12 that is attached to the food. Then it combines to the transcobalamin (TC) and haptocorrin (HC) which are proteins made by the stomach and forms complexes called as holotranscobalamin (HoloTC) and holohaptocorrin (HoloHC). HoloTC is also known as active-B12 as this is the only form of vitamin-B12 that is taken up and used by the cells of the body.","The Vitamin-B12 Conventional Blood Test is performed to check whether an individual is having normal or abnormal levels of Vitamin-B12 in the blood. The doctor may ask to perform this test if an individual is suffering from conditions like pernicious anemia (decrease in red blood cells as the body cannot absorb enough vitamin-B12), inflammatory bowel disease (inflammation of the digestive tract), Crohn's disease (redness and swelling in the lining of the digestive tract), chronic alcoholism (heavy drinking of alcohol), liver disease, heart failure, obesity etc. This test is also done to determine the risk of developing anemia. If symptoms like decreased appetite, trouble walking, weak muscles, weight loss, fast heart rate, irritability, lack of energy etc are seen in an individual then the doctor may prefer to do this test. If an individual is on the treatment of vitamin-B12 then the doctor may ask to perform this test to evaluate and to check the effectiveness of the treatment and vitamin-B12 levels in the body. This helps the doctor to rule out the patient disease condition.Generally, when a patient is diagnosed with liver disease, intestinal disorders or malnutrition visits hospital for a general check-up, the doctor may ask to undergo the conventional vitamin-B12 blood test which gives a better status of the condition. This test is also performed to provide a clear idea regarding the malnutrition, liver disease of an individual.  Mostly, this test is done along with other vitamin tests to confirm the diagnosis.

If the test results are more than the normal range then there may be a chance for Diabetes mellitus, heart failure, AIDS, severe liver disease, obesity etc.If test results are less than the normal range, then it indicates that there may be a chance for pernicious anemia (decrease in red blood cells as the body cannot absorb enough vitamin-B12), Crohn's disease (redness and swelling in the lining of the digestive tract), inflammatory bowel disease, chronic alcoholism (heavy drinking of alcohol), low consumption of the diet containing vitamin-B12, malabsorption etc.GenderAge groupsValue",https://www.practo.com/tests/vitamin-b12-conventional-blood/p?city=bangalore
CBC Test,Complete Blood Count Automated Blood,₹300,"Complete Blood Count (CBC) is a blood test that measures Red blood cells (RBC), White blood cells (WBC), Platelets (PLTs), Hemoglobin (Hb), and Hematocrit (Hct) in the blood. This test is used to determine the overall health and screen for any diseases that affect the blood cells. What is Blood cells, Hemoglobin, and Hematocrit?Blood is composed of cells and necessary substances such as nutrients and oxygen needed for the health. The blood cells are produced in bone marrow and are released into the blood. It provides nutrients and helps in the transport of gases within cells and tissues.The three main types of blood cells are:Red Blood Cells (RBC):Red blood cells contain a complex protein called hemoglobin. It carries oxygen to the body's organs and tissues from the lungs.White Blood Cells (WBC):White blood cells also called as leukocytes that help to protect the body against infections and foreign invaders, thus an important part of our immune system. These cells are originated from bone marrow but circulate throughout the bloodstream.Platelets (PLTs):Platelets are the smallest blood cells that help the blood to clot during bleeding. Hemoglobin and Hematocrit are other two important substances in the blood. Hemoglobin is a complex protein found in red blood cells. It carries oxygen to the body's organs and tissues from the lungs. It also transports carbon dioxide from the body back to the lungs. Hematocrit is the percentage of red blood cell found in the whole blood. ","This test is performed as part of a routine check-up to monitor the overall health of an individual.  Your doctor may ask you to perform this test to diagnose or to screen for diseases and conditions such as anemia, infections, cancer, or any bleeding disorder.

Anemic patients should perform this test on a regular basis, as instructed by the doctor.Pathology test parameters: Red blood cells (RBC), White blood cells (WBC), Platelets (PLTs), Hemoglobin (Hb) and Hematocrit (Hct).Also known as CBC Automated Blood, Complete Blood Picture Automated Blood, CBP Automated Blood, Absolute Blood Count Automated Blood, Complete Blood Count, Platelet Test, WBC Test, Absolute Count, CBC, CBP, Complete Count, Complete Picture, Neutrophils Test, Hb PCV Test.Test PreparationInform your doctor if you are on any medications, have any allergies or underlying medical conditions before your CBC Test. Your doctor will give specific instructions depending on your condition on how to prepare for CBC Test.No specific preparation is required for this test. However, follow all the instructions given by your healthcare provider.Understanding your test resultsGenerally, there is no need for medical interventions if test results are in normal range.If the red blood cells, hemoglobin, and hematocrit levels are lower than the normal range, it may indicate different types of anemia such as iron deficiency anemia, sickle cell anemia, etc. Some medical conditions such as hypothyroidism, splenomegaly (an enlarged spleen), leukemia (a type of blood cancer), chronic kidney disease, internal bleeding due to a stomach ulcer, stomach or colon cancer, etc. may also cause low levels. Deficiency of iron, vitamin B-12,  and folic acid; recent blood donations; heavy prolonged menstrual bleeding, etc. may also result in low levels.If the red blood cells, hemoglobin, and hematocrit levels are higher than the normal range, it may indicate a condition called polycythemia, a type of cancer where the bone marrow produces too many red blood cells.  Medical conditions such as heart or lung diseases, dehydration, etc. may also result in higher levels.If the white blood cell count is lower than the normal range, it may indicate autoimmune disorder like lupus and ulcerative colitis, bone marrow problems, or cancer. If the white blood cell count is higher than the normal range, it may indicate bacterial infections like tuberculosis, viral infections, and fungus. Use of certain medications such as steroids, lithium, and some inhalers may also increase the white blood count.Lower than the normal levels of platelet count is known as thrombocytopenia. This may occur due to medical conditions such as leukemia (a type of blood cancer), aplastic anemia, viral infections, some autoimmune disorders, splenomegaly (an enlarged spleen), cirrhosis of the liver, kidney dysfunction, etc. Other factors such as chemotherapy drugs (cancer medicines); vitamin B12, iron, or folic acid deficiency; chronic alcohol use, etc. may also cause thrombocytopenia.Higher than the normal levels of platelet count is known as thrombocytosis. Thrombocytosis is categorized as primary or essential thrombocytosis and secondary thrombocytosis. Primary thrombocytosis is an uncommon disorder; it generally occurs in individuals greater than 50 years of age, especially in women. It occurs when your bone marrow produces too many platelets. Secondary thrombocytosis may occur due to an ongoing disease condition, certain infections, cancer, anemia, major surgery or trauma, removal of the spleen, etc. Based on the test results, your doctor may advise appropriate medical treatments, lifestyle modifications, or further diagnostic tests.GenderAge groupsValueUNISEXAll age groupsWBC-4000 to 11000 cellsUNISEXAll age groups40-70%UNISEXAll age groups20-40%UNISEXAll age groups2-10%UNISEXAll age groups1-2%UNISEXAll age groups1-8%MALEAll age groups4.32-5.72 million/mcLFEMALEAll age groups3.9-5.03 million/mcLMALEAll age groups40.7-50.3%FEMALEAll age groups36.1 to 44.3%MALEAll age groups13.8-17.2 gm/dlFEMALEAll age groups12.5-15.1g/dlUNISEXAll age groups80-95flYour Cart0 TestsProceed to CheckoutPopular Health Checkup PackagesFeatured CheckupsDiabetes CareWomen's HealthMen's HealthComprehensive Active Professional Health CheckupIdeal for individuals aged 41 - 60 years114 tests included₹3499₹490029% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowAdvanced Young Indian Health CheckupIdeal for individuals aged 21 - 40 years63 tests included₹1799₹280036% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowAdvanced Diabetic Screening CheckupIdeal for individuals aged 35 - 85 years70 tests included₹2199₹300027% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowAdvanced Diabetic Patient's Health CheckupIdeal for individuals aged 35 - 85 years89 tests included₹3599₹500028% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowWomen's PCOD Detection CheckupIdeal for individuals aged 18 - 45 years37 tests included₹1799₹250028% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowWomen's Skincare CheckupIdeal for individuals aged 15 - 60 years44 tests included₹3499₹550036% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowComprehensive Active Professional Health CheckupIdeal for individuals aged 41 - 60 years114 tests included₹3499₹490029% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowAdvanced Young Indian Health CheckupIdeal for individuals aged 21 - 40 years63 tests included₹1799₹280036% off+ 10% Health cashback* T&CBook NowThousands of Happy Customers“Very professional phlebo.

Deficiency of iron, vitamin B-12,  and folic acid; recent blood donations; heavy prolonged menstrual bleeding, etc. may also result in low levels.If the red blood cells, hemoglobin, and hematocrit levels are higher than the normal range, it may indicate a condition called polycythemia, a type of cancer where the bone marrow produces too many red blood cells.  Medical conditions such as heart or lung diseases, dehydration, etc. may also result in higher levels.If the white blood cell count is lower than the normal range, it may indicate autoimmune disorder like lupus and ulcerative colitis, bone marrow problems, or cancer. If the white blood cell count is higher than the normal range, it may indicate bacterial infections like tuberculosis, viral infections, and fungus. Use of certain medications such as steroids, lithium, and some inhalers may also increase the white blood count.Lower than the normal levels of platelet count is known as thrombocytopenia. This may occur due to medical conditions such as leukemia (a type of blood cancer), aplastic anemia, viral infections, some autoimmune disorders, splenomegaly (an enlarged spleen), cirrhosis of the liver, kidney dysfunction, etc. Other factors such as chemotherapy drugs (cancer medicines); vitamin B12, iron, or folic acid deficiency; chronic alcohol use, etc. may also cause thrombocytopenia.Higher than the normal levels of platelet count is known as thrombocytosis. Thrombocytosis is categorized as primary or essential thrombocytosis and secondary thrombocytosis. Primary thrombocytosis is an uncommon disorder; it generally occurs in individuals greater than 50 years of age, especially in women. It occurs when your bone marrow produces too many platelets. Secondary thrombocytosis may occur due to an ongoing disease condition, certain infections, cancer, anemia, major surgery or trauma, removal of the spleen, etc. Based on the test results, your doctor may advise appropriate medical treatments, lifestyle modifications, or further diagnostic tests.GenderAge groupsValueUNISEXAll age groupsWBC-4000 to 11000 cellsUNISEXAll age groups40-70%UNISEXAll age groups20-40%UNISEXAll age groups2-10%UNISEXAll age groups1-2%UNISEXAll age groups1-8%MALEAll age groups4.32-5.72 million/mcLFEMALEAll age groups3.9-5.03 million/mcLMALEAll age groups40.7-50.3%FEMALEAll age groups36.1 to 44.3%MALEAll age groups13.8-17.2 gm/dlFEMALEAll age groups12.5-15.1g/dlUNISEXAll age groups80-95fl",https://www.practo.com/tests/complete-blood-count-automated-blood/p?city=bangalore
TSH Test,Thyroid Stimulating Hormone Blood,₹200,This test is used to measure the levels of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) in the blood.

Hyperthyroidism is a condition where the thyroid gland produces too many hormones. This condition may cause signs and symptoms such as a sudden weight loss, irritability, sweating, irregular heartbeats, etc. Hypothyroidism is a condition where the thyroid gland does not produce enough amount of hormones.
