Antibodies are the protective proteins produced by the immune system and also known as immunoglobulins. Antibodies are produced when any foreign substance or virus or bacteria enters into the body. These foreign substances are known as antigens. Antibodies recognize and attach to the antigens in order to remove them from the body.What is H.Pylori?Helicobacter Pylori H. Pylori is a spiral-shaped bacteria and attack the lining of the stomach. Due to its spiral shape, it penetrates into the stomach and gets protected by the mucus. Hence, immune cells are not able to reach them. This bacteria cause serious stomach problems like peptic ulcer, gastritis and most of the stomach ulcers.What are antibodies and their importance?Antibodies are in Y shaped and have two large heavy chains and two small light chains. It has Fc region at the bottom of Y. This Fc region is the part of the antibody which attaches to the antigen. Depending on the Fc region, the antibodies are of five (5) subtypes. They are IgG, IgM, IgA, IgD, IgE.IgG provides long-term protection as it presents in the circulation for long period after the presence of an antigen. IgM is involved in the ABO blood group antigens on the red blood cells (RBC’s) surface. IgM also enhances the ingestion of cells by phagocytosis. IgA is also the first defense for intestine, lungs, and nose. They bind antigens to the microbes before they invade tissues and keeps antigens in secretion and when secretion is expelled, antigens are also expelled. IgD helps in the induction of antibody production and presents on the surface of B-cells. IgE binds to the basophils and mast cells. Why this test is performed?This test is performed to check the presence of H.Pylori Antibodies IgG in blood. The doctor may ask you to undergo this test if you are suffering from conditions such as peptic ulcer, gastritis etc. If symptoms like burning sensation in abdominal pain during the night or after few hours of having food, intestinal bleeding, tenderness, excessive burping, lack of appetite, unexplained weight loss, blood in stools, trouble in swallowing, anemia etc. are seen in an individual, then the doctor may recommend doing this test. If an individual is on the treatment of medications like clarithromycin, omeprazole, amoxicillin, then the doctor may ask to perform this test to evaluate and to check the effectiveness of the treatment and H.Pylori antibodies IgG levels in the blood. Mostly, this test is done along with other antibody tests to confirm the diagnosis.","Some medications may change the levels of IgG in the blood and hence you are advised to inform all your current medications to the doctor prior to the test.Also known as H Pylori Antibodies IgG ELISA Blood, H Pylori Antibodies IgG.","Inform your doctor if you are on any medications, have any allergies or underlying medical conditions before your Helicobacter Pylori Antibodies IgG.

Sometimes false positive may occur due to IgG antibodies stay for a long time in blood even after the infection is gone. This test can not tell perfectly whether the infection is a current or past infection.GenderAge groupsValueOTHERAll age groupsThe antibodies are not normally present.

Chloride,Chloride Blood,₹200,The chloride blood test is used to estimate levels of chloride in the blood. This test is usually a part of the basic metabolic panel or a routine blood test. It is used to diagnose a condition relating to an imbalance of acids and bases in the body called as acidosis and alkalosis. Acidosis is a condition in which high levels of acid is seen in blood. Alkalosis is a condition in which blood is too alkaline or basic.  What is Chloride?Chloride is an important mineral and a type of electrolyte which works with other electrolytes like potassium and sodium. Chloride is an electrically charged mineral and helps balance acids and bases in the body. It also moves fluid in and out of the cells. Hence low levels of chloride may lead to dehydration and high levels indicate improper functioning of kidneys. ,"This test may be recommended to you if you experience certain symptoms like tiredness, weakness, vomiting, diarrhea or dehydration. This test may also be recommended to check certain conditions like hyperchloremia or hypochloremia, hyperventilation, metabolic acidosis,  respiratory acidosis, etc. Sometimes diabetes can also elevate the levels of chloride. Other electrolyte tests may be ordered to see the acid-base imbalance.Precautions:Some medications may interfere with your test results such as diuretics (thiazide, furosemide, torsemide, etc), NSAIDs  (acetaminophen, naproxen, ibuprofen, etc) and certain hormones. Intake of large quantities of baking soda and overdose of antacids may cause low levels of chloride in blood. Hence inform your doctor or technician about all your current medications and medical conditions prior to the test.Also known as Chloride (Cl-) Blood, Chloride Test, Chloride (Cl-).Test PreparationInform your doctor if you are on any medications, have any allergies or underlying medical conditions before your Chloride.

Hyperchloremia condition is a result of dehydration but may also occur with high levels of sodium in some conditions like kidney disease or Cushing's syndrome. Hyperchloremia condition is seen when high amounts of the base are lost from the body leading to metabolic acidosis or it is also due to hyperventilation.If your test results are lower than the normal range then it may indicate a condition called hypochloremia (low level of blood chloride). This condition may occur due to any disorders relating to low levels of blood sodium. This condition is also seen with congestive heart failure, lung diseases causing respiratory acidosis, many episodes of vomiting or prolonged gastric suction, due to losing acid from the body (metabolic alkalosis), Addison’s disease (where adrenal glands do not release enough hormones).If you get abnormal test results does not always mean you have a medical condition.
