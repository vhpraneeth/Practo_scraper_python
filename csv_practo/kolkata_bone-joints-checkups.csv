PTH,Parathyroid Hormone Blood,₹800,This test is used to investigate the levels of parathyroid hormone (PTH) in the blood sample of an individual. The parathyroid hormone is responsible for maintaining the normal levels of calcium and Vitamin D in the body.  ,"The parathyroid hormone regulates the levels of calcium in the body. It is produced by 4 parathyroid glands which are located behind the thyroid gland in the neck. Low levels of calcium in the body stimulate the release of calcium into the blood and absorption of vitamin D from the intestines and the release of the parathyroid hormone will be reduced in the presence of high amounts of calcium in the blood which increases the level of calcium excreted through urine or vice-versa.  The levels of parathyroid hormone are evaluated along with other parameters like serum electrolytes ( phosphorus, magnesium), vitamin D, calcium levels in urine and blood.",,"This test is recommended by the doctor if an individual has signs or symptoms of calcium deficiency like weakness, nausea, muscle pain, tingly feeling of hands and feet, pain in the abdomen, feeling of thirst, irregular heartbeat, weak bones, etc. ","Inform your doctor if you are on any medications, have any allergies or underlying medical conditions before your PTH.
