LFT Test,Liver Function Tests Blood,₹400,"Liver function test is a set of blood tests used to monitor the working of the liver or to screen the liver damage or inflammation. This test helps in diagnosing a liver disease or liver condition. This test also measures the amount of certain enzymes and proteins in the blood. Some of these tests are helpful in estimating the performance of the liver functions like producing proteins, clearing of waste products in blood like bilirubin and some tests are used to measure the amount of enzymes that are produced by the liver which may indicate damage of the liver. ","The liver is the vital organ present in your body. It is reddish brown in color which may weigh around 3 pounds. The gallbladder is attached at the bottom of the liver along with pancreas and intestines. Liver and these organs help in digestion, absorption, and processing of food. The liver filters the blood which comes from the digestive tract and transports the filtered blood to the remaining parts of the body. The liver also makes proteins which are used for blood clotting and also albumin an important protein in blood serum which transports fatty acids and steroids. It also absorbs and metabolizes bilirubin. Bilirubin is formed as the result of the breakdown of hemoglobin, liver stores the iron released by hemoglobin and utilizes it to make the next generation of red blood cells. It also helps in fat metabolization by breaking down fats and making them digest easily. Liver stores carbohydrates which can be broken down into glucose and later used as energy when needed. It also filters blood from waste products, including alcohol and other drugs. Vitamin A, D, E, K, and B12 are stored by the liver.",,"Liver function tests are mainly used to estimate the severity of a disease like alcoholic hepatitis or viral hepatitis, to detect liver infections like hepatitis or scarring of a liver (cirrhosis), to know the effectiveness of a treatment, to detect the side effects of certain medicines. ","Inform your doctor if you are on any medications, have any allergies or underlying medical conditions before your LFT Test. Your doctor will give specific instructions depending on your condition on how to prepare for LFT Test.","The normal test results may vary depending on gender, age, health history, etc.",https://www.practo.com/tests/liver-function-tests-blood/p?city=hyderabad
BUN,Urea Nitrogen Blood,₹200,This test measures the amount of urea nitrogen in the blood.  ,"Urea is a waste product formed in the liver as a result of protein breakdown. This urea is then released into the blood by the liver. Normally, it is then removed from the blood by the kidneys. Kidneys filter urea and it gets removed from the body through urination. ",,"This test is one among many tests used to evaluate your kidney function. Your doctor may ask to perform this test if you experience any signs and symptoms of kidney damage such as fatigue, bloody, coffee-colored or foamy urine, frequent urination, swelling on face, arms, stomach, legs, feet or around eyes, nausea or vomiting, weakness, muscle cramps etc. You may be advised to undergo this test if you have diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure or a family history of kidney problems. Your doctor may also ask to perform this test to check the effectiveness of dialysis treatment in case if you are receiving hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. This test may also be performed with other blood tests to rule out other medical conditions, such as liver damage, urinary tract obstruction, congestive heart failure or gastrointestinal bleeding. But these conditions are not diagnosed by this test. ","Inform your doctor if you are on any medications, have any allergies or underlying medical conditions before your BUN. Your doctor will give specific instructions depending on your condition on how to prepare for BUN.",If the test result falls in the normal reference range generally no medical intervention is necessary. The BUN levels may be normal even when if one kidney is damaged and the other is functional.,https://www.practo.com/tests/urea-nitrogen-blood/p?city=hyderabad
Lipase,Lipase Blood,₹340,This test is used to measure the amount of lipase present in your blood. This test is used to identify the presence of any infections/damage to the pancreas of an individual. The pancreas is an internal organ located in the upper right quadrant of the abdomen and plays a role in the digestive and metabolic system of the body. ,Lipase is produced by the pancreas in the body. It is a protein-based enzyme which plays a role in the digestion and breakdown of fats in the stomach. Impaired function of the pancreas due to injury or infections or diseases may lead to increased or decreased release of lipase from the pancreas. Lipase levels can be used to diagnose any disease/condition which may be affecting the function of pancreas.,,"Your doctor may recommend this test if you are experiencing symptoms like nausea, vomiting, severe back or abdominal pain, loss of appetite, etc. ","Inform your doctor if you are on any medications, have any allergies or underlying medical conditions before your Lipase. Your doctor will give specific instructions depending on your condition on how to prepare for Lipase.","If the test results fall in the normal reference range generally no medical intervention is necessary.
High levels of lipase in the blood may indicate pancreatitis, kidney diseases, any blockage in the pancreas, gallstones or any problem with your gall balder, etc",https://www.practo.com/tests/lipase-blood/p?city=hyderabad
TTG IgA Test,Tissue Transglutaminase Antibodies Iga Elisa Blood,₹660,This test is used to find out the tissue transglutaminase antibodies-IgA in the blood. ,"Antibodies are the protective proteins produced by the immune system and known as immunoglobulins. Antibodies are produced when any foreign substance or virus or bacteria enters into the body. These foreign substances are known as antigens. Antibodies recognize and attach to the antigens in order to remove them from the body. There are five (5) subtypes of antibodies and they are IgG, IgM, IgA, IgD, IgE.","IgG provides long-term protection as it presents in the circulation for long period after the presence of an antigen. IgM enhances the ingestion of cells by phagocytosis. IgA is also the first defense for intestine, lungs, and nose. They bind antigens to the microbes before they invade tissues and keeps antigens in secretion and when secretion is expelled, antigens are also expelled. IgD helps in the induction of antibody production and presents on the surface of B-cells. IgE binds to the basophils and mast cells.",* ,"Inform your doctor if you are on any medications, have any allergies or underlying medical conditions before your TTG IgA Test. Your doctor will give specific instructions depending on your condition on how to prepare for TTG IgA Test.","The test results may be different depending on gender, age, health conditions, and other factors.",https://www.practo.com/tests/tissue-transglutaminase-antibodies-iga-elisa-blood/p?city=hyderabad
